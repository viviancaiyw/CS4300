lackluster that not say that the game isn good there are quite number high points for which the game deserves praise but also feel that there are number disconnects between what the game tries and what actually does such might not recommend for the wider audience gamers experience while have not read the book have played the previous two installments the series originally purchased the whole trilogy part sale since wanted experience the whole story least the one told the games decided play through the series from start finish experience being able get into the game was problem that had with each game the series for playthrough the witcher opted tackle game the hardest difficulty death march some extent believe this choice had negative impact experience regarding combat see the bad and the ugly below also completed both the dlc expansions hearts stone and blood and wine while have hard time recommending the witcher general audience would recommend playing both expansions you enjoyed the base game particularly blood and wine the good the world one thing about the game the extent which the world feels like living breathing things the world geralt lives filled with conflicts political racial and supernatural natures sure there are the odd things such some shopkeepers staying open all hours the day non combat npcs ignoring the fact that you just butchered cow but these seem somewhat inconsequential the wider scope how the gameworld looks and feels there also plenty explore truly enjoyed traveling from one point interest the next see what would uncover finding contracts hunt down the more challenging beasts that the game presents many cases found this experience more enjoyable than pursuing the main storyline the storytelling while wasn quite thrilled with the story the game feel like one place where the game shined was how well told the story the main plot and the smaller side adventure terms polish the voice acting was very well done while most the quests were the fetch kill target variety majority the marked quests had somewhat satisfying stories with them drawing you bit more into the world the bad and the ugly pacing one major complaint with all three the witcher games just how hard get immersed the games begin with the main plot the game seems drag with geralt chasing leads while praise the storytelling many ways find that the focus the narrative often takes control away from the player cinematics and dialogs can lengthy times and often found myself reading subtitles and quickly advancing through lines and lines dialog you enjoy visual novels this may not problem but for game billed more action rpg felt like the pace crawled along for game its size and scope this makes hard for consider venturing full second playthrough even with the new game option controls for playthrough used microsoft xbox controller though frequently found myself using keyboard shortcuts quickly access submenus for game released multiple platforms didn feel like the controls were well done for release there are different controls for general movement combat swimming horseback riding and sailing each these categories there were times where the controls felt less than responsive worse geralt would the opposite what was doing stopping the horse while wanted gallop diving back under the water while holding the surface button dancing around while tried mount small obstacle etc some extent criticism here stems from the fact that felt similar control issues between general movements and combat were present the witcher assassins kings and that these problems were not addressed when developing the newer game times felt like the game was more about fighting the controls than the monster combat with assassins kings felt the combat wild hunt bit stuffy and heavily bogged down the less responsive camera while there are variety enemy types requiring different tactics dispatch with ease found the death march difficulty made combat effect whittlefest against damage sponges even employing the best tactics usually still resulted most the battle being dominated the tactic using quen and then applying the combo strike and back step until the enemies dispatched side note you not achievement hound looking get the achievements single run recommend not playing death march for your first run noticed the issues had with the combat system became far less noticeable when went back and tried playing lower difficulties connection mechanics and narrative biggest complaint how the mechanics the game don always fit together nor they always fit the narrative while the longer narrative fitting for rpg the rpg elements the game don quite match with geralt being master witcher the butcher blaviken especially you playing the harder difficulty levels and the earlier stages the game why that after having fully regained his memory and two previous witcher titles geralt still has find the basic formulae for witcher potions and bombs how that master swordsman can use steel sword dropped common bandit because his level too low suspension disbelief while understand that common theme rpgs that your character slowly improving getting stronger expanding their skills and getting better equipment feel the mechanics particularly related equipment fall far short the witcher one the great things about open world games the ability explore and players are rewarded for their exploration with new gear addition experience the witcher you often find awesome gear schematics for cool stuff that above your level which means you can use and the time you can use you likely have already found something equally good not better the end you end making habit selling off that cool loot you got for clearing monster den because you never actually use this makes exploration the world which noted above great thing altogether less satisfying final thoughts really want like the witcher wild hunt more than want buy into the hype and say one the best games but can for was slog that found moderately rewarding the combat wasn smooth games even few years older making hard recommend action fans the rpg mechanics are times flawed and frustrating still you can get around those two things and have the patience for more drawn out story you can find potentially rewarding adventure verdict you can catch sale might recommend buying discount you may one the people who love not you won disappointed with your purchase because you gave before finishing the prologue',\n",

great dealbreaker this case this you care mostly about good story characters and world building you should consider whether buy not but you really need solid gameplay behind say absolute usually try separate pros and cons but think this case demands mixture back before even tried the game out was kinda skeptical had actually played around the first witcher considering that was the first game the series back the clunky gameplay didn hit that hard thought that people were exaggerating bit about cause should built that foundation after many years right but now rest assured that indeed not exaggeration and truly shame cause said you are solely searching for good story the game great but sometimes even that feels drag just because you know that some point you are going thrown back into combat for instance you have these three bosses the end most them have been hyped throughout the whole game they are quite intimidating they aren just hiding some wee castle alone waiting for fight they leave the first mark the scene when they appear the pay out damage sponge that has two three cycles attack may catch you off guard the first two times but that the last time feels cheap gets melee techniques are reduced two but there barely difference magic abilities are like and yet only one them doesn seem pointless potions oils used couple through the game but that attacks connect depending some kind rhythm you may hit from times then the enemy will except for some minor ones retort gets old really quickly and again turns mayor enemies and bosses into sponges that are there just take timesfold more damage feels felt the beginning that was doing something wrong but came realize eventually that this how never feels good truly shame and not only because the story get the choice behind giving limited amount magic abilities praised dishonored for doing and still kinda appreciate even most the abilities were pointless the end while progressing shifted from maining one spell the other discovered how use each one better but again truly shame those choices and learning wouldn matter the end was impressed the whole potion and oil business but another thing that fell pointless gathering ingredients doesn matter because most them can bought money stops being problem after the introduction they are more unique can obtained during missions tho this point praise the thing that after you make them there much use them least not the default difficulty mode increasing vitality increasing defense increasing damage sure there are lot but they are merely stats modifiers nothing interesting unlock techniques some sort transformation though guess that probably goes against the lore somehow kinda the same thing goes for bombs there are couple with good effects but ultimately pointless this problem obviously also affects the character progression truth told here you unlock some new and interesting techniques but there still lots generic upgrades plus percent this plus percent that one thing that you have equip these upgrades sort limited slots which limits geralt power even the long run which great touch for post game and higher difficulties but combat not the most frustrating thing navigation your true enemy out combat walking and running mostly fine swimming has real problem shallow water and high seas ironically diving sometimes deactivated for reason like the control routine doesn change fallen through the bottom the map twice while the sea impossible leave boat when combat boat because you roll into the deck and something else actually enjoyed exploring all the points interest skellige before that they were quite interesting there was some variety but hitting skellige all you find chest the middle boring empty sea this part really felt like downgrade back navigation still out combat think found the worst equine companion all games have you seen the beasts cyrodiil those bastards can climb degrees slope roach tho well get that this world not much high fantasy but come you can barely control bastard will try steer its own some times others with apparent consistency will drive you into the woods stop the first twig his path course walking was hell and yet usually take minutes that meant not spending horseback and combat you don really fight horse most the time doesn matter but boy the controls during combat trying run away from low level enemies laugh because you may sheathe the sword and start running but geralt will eventually just turn around and pull guard with his fists screwing your retreat not focusing enemies doesn seem have much impact the movement geralt still faces the closes one and attacks luckily enough are always fixed the closest enemy here you can either dodge roll both moves will give you invincibility time matter how looks game sometimes tho feels like you lose control the direction you dodge roll based how the movement changes depending the closest enemy and dodging usually safer cause god has rolling killed too many times speaking which parrying and counter attack just parrying became kinda pointless the end the game aswell most attacks break through your defense counter attack quite useful against humans the first part the game but shows yet another miss the combat system and probably was the last straw for agree that combat horrendous matter which point your animation attack you are you have your back turned attacking enemy pressing the button parry any time when they attack you triggers counter attack even has ghost one that said worth mentioning that the story not always that good and repeat loved haven read the books yet all well presented the dialogues are great and all feels right even you are not familiar with the novels and know that ain always easy manage but there stuff that because how some cutscenes are acted out bit disappointing awkward especially when there object the characters are interacting with zoom face yet all and all even combat doesn really work somehow feel that great effort was made with the game just lacked some polish and taking couple better decisions regarding design bit repetitive and with pointless additions nothing really new for the good the bad just that feel like people should expect and receive bit more from game that receives such good praise not all undeserved and probably because see why would they praise why try look with bit harshly and hey points for making dlcs that are apparently another whole campaign good reason come back some day the game maybe add the challenge more difficult mode and relive great story great game long you know what you are looking for',\n",

will feel the game this part will break your soul and you can see bleeding out really affects you your daily mood and you wont forget this things easily now the advices before can actually review the game this game without mods unplayable you will need these mods all them can found nexus mods mandatory mods patch version the game version steam which only translates and localizes the game chinese you will need patch gain access the console debug console enabler enables the console for the game and requirements for some complex mods script merger merges mods automatically mandatory because many mods naturally break the game each other mod limit fix game wont load menues will stuck infinite loading screens you dont have this instant sign casting this before changing ini files fixes the micromanagament fights and especially for the dlcs mandatory slots slots slots increases the ability slots almost and removes the level restriction appearances menu mod you can decide how you want look mandatory because the horrible outfit design the game next thing that the game has slightly but nevertheless annoying tearing effect especially occuring stone environments like novigrad your nvidia control panel and activate triple buffering that affects every game like usual vsync doesnt work all now the final issue will most likely spoil the game just lettin you know alright here wow what masterpiece rarely was emotionally driven like this game anger depression joy tears love and adrenaline this game takes you and you cant let very rarely was tired playing the game and its one the very rare occasions would recommend you buy the game for the full price its absolutely worth dont miss out the expansions especially blood and wine partly more pleasing than the fantastic base game and think was overall best experience this game see everything this game one playthrough you will need least hours and you read everything then you will probably need more than hours thats absolutely amazing and really not lot singleplayer games can proud that archievement this game legendary and all the hype deserved embarassing for the gaming industry that company and country not well known for video games can pull this one off shame you now that already shows that the game that legendary and popular because the lack concurrenting games the game partly very clunky and most the critiques are true the main positives this game are the fantastic story and the strong authentic charaters the solid amount roleplay the very pleasant exploration the overwhelming atmosphere and ofcourse decent mod scene the main negatives are the clunky and repetitive combat the overload bugs the weird limitation the character development gameplaywise and unbalanced character individuality the story the story about geralt rivia experienced witcher witchers are hybrids between warriors and mages but their focus still physicality atleast the game they are mutated humans and run through awful ritual kids only
