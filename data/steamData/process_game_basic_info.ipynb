Crusader Kings III is the heir to a long legacy of historical grand strategy experiences and arrives with a host of new ways to ensure the success of your royal house. Choose a royal or noble house from a number of realms on a map that stretches from Iceland to India, from the Arctic Circle to Central Africa. Guide a dynasty through the centuries, ensuring the security and power of each new generation. Gather new lands and titles to cement your legacy. Be a pious king to bring the religious powers to your side, or strike out on your own, designing your own splinter religion and earning everlasting fame or eternal damnation. Knights, peasant revolts, pilgrimages, Viking raiders... experience the drama and pageantry of the Middle Ages. Adopt one of five different lifestyles, perfecting your skills in military strategy or kingdom management. Acquire character traits that will guide your actions, but beware if you act against your nature! The stress from denying your truest self could bring a new host of troubles! Choose appropriate guardians for your heirs, or train them yourself. But what do you do if the legal heir is not quite up to the job? Violent characters may develop a fearsome reputation, cowering your timid subjects into obedience with the dread you inspire. Recruit men-at-arms units and powerful knights to supplement your royal levies. Research new technologies to increase the wealth and military might of your realm. Hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major wars.  Supplement your income with ransomed prisoners or raiding parties on neighboring realms. Use your spymaster to discover plots against your dynasty and your rule. Recruit agents to assist your schemes to undermine or murder anyone who stands between you and power. Seduce other characters for love or political power. Gather information for blackmailing purposes or call in favors whenever your plans need an extra bit of influence.',\n",

This update disabled online functionality (such as Casual and Competitive Playlists) for players on macOS and Linux, but offline features including Local Matches, and splitscreen play are still accessible.Please note that Rocket League® on SteamOS and macOS may have bugs and stability issues not seen in the Windows version of the game, and these issues may not be fixed in future updates.NOTE: Because of agreements with our online service provider, there are certain regions that are unable to connect to Rocket League®’s online multiplayer component. As a result, server access is restricted in China, Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. Apologies to our customers in those regions.Software and online features are subject to license, terms of use, and privacy policy ( rocketleague.com/eula , rocketleague.com/tou ,  and rocketleague.com/privacy ).\",\n",

Become Ruler of the World by establishing and leading a civilization from the Stone Age to the Information Age. Wage war, conduct diplomacy, advance your culture, and go head-to-head with history’s greatest leaders as you attempt to build the greatest civilization the world has ever known.Civilization VI offers new ways to engage with your world: cities now physically expand across the map, active research in technology and culture unlocks new potential, and competing leaders will pursue their own agendas based on their historical traits as you race for one of five ways to achieve victory in the game.EXPANSIVE EMPIRES: See the marvels of your empire spread across the map like never before. Each city spans multiple tiles so you can custom build your cities to take full advantage of the local terrain.ACTIVE RESEARCH: Unlock boosts that speed your civilization’s progress through history. To advance more quickly, use your units to actively explore, develop your environment, and discover new cultures. DYNAMIC DIPLOMACY: Interactions with other civilizations change over the course of the game, from primitive first interactions where conflict is a fact of life, to late game alliances and negotiations. COMBINED ARMS: Expanding on the “one unit per tile” design, support units can now be embedded with other units, like anti-tank support with infantry, or a warrior with settlers. Similar units can also be combined to form powerful “Corps” units.ENHANCED MULTIPLAYER: In addition to traditional multiplayer modes, cooperate and compete with your friends in a wide variety of situations all designed to be easily completed in a single session. A CIV FOR ALL PLAYERS: Civilization VI provides veteran players new ways to build and tune their civilization for the greatest chance of success. New tutorial systems introduce new players to the underlying concepts so they can easily get started.',\n",

       "  'full_bio': 'As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!Dinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new \"Engrams\" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you\\'ll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D \"Explorer Notes\". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK\\'s by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique \\'Procedurally Generated ARKs\\', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting & global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) & true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

       "  'full_bio': 'About This ContentIsle of Siptah is a massive expansion to the open world survival game Conan Exiles, featuring a vast new island to explore, huge and vile new creatures to slay, new building sets and a whole new gameplay cycle. Fight the elder races in new underground dungeons. Defeat demonic monstrosities that spawn from a storm of pure chaos. Dominate the surge to secure the island’s only supply of thralls.You arrive at the island shipwrecked and alone. With nothing but the scraps on your back, you craft the tools you need to survive. At first a simple camp and some crude stone tools, with time a fortress and brutal greatswords made from hardened steel or obsidian. Your eyes are drawn towards the center of the island, where a dark tower looms above the landscape. The violent storm that swirls around it seems to gather strength and unspeakable horrors stalk within. But your most dangerous foe may be the other survivors on the island, as resources are scarce and the fight for survival is savage and brutal.     Start a fresh, new experience on the massive Isle of Siptah. Explore sun-drenched beaches strewn with shipwrecks, dense and tall Redwood forests, broad valleys dotted with ancient Acheronian ruins, the remains of a Stygian colony, and the foreboding Tower of Siptah at the island’s center. Uncover long-forgotten vaults holding the remnants of elder races from a distant past. Discover hidden halls, solve ancient puzzles, and slay the fiends and demons within. Loot valuable treasures and harness the power of the sigils of the elder races.A massive storm swirls around the dark tower at the center of the island. Powered by sinister magic, it spawns horrifying monsters from the outer void, attacking anyone who dares to venture or build within. Defeat these horrors to get your hands on a brand new and important resource.Powerful surges of forbidden magic, granted by the elder god of Nyarlathotep, shoot forth from the Tower of Siptah. Humans and creatures appear in their wake, mysteriously teleported from the outside world. Move quick to capture them or be left in the dust as other players build their army.Charge into battle and slay your enemies from atop the ferocious rhino mount. Construct a small home or a vast city using two new building sets: the waterlogged remains of shipwrecks or the ancient and majestic stormglass.

The game introduces new game play elements to realize the thrill and hardships of creating and maintaining a real city whilst expanding on some well-established tropes of the city building experience.From the makers of the Cities in Motion franchise, the game boasts a fully realized transport system. It also includes the ability to mod the game to suit your play style as a fine counter balance to the layered and challenging simulation. You’re only limited by your imagination, so take control and reach for the sky!Multi-tiered and challenging simulationConstructing your city from the ground up is easy to learn, but hard to master. Playing as the mayor of your city you’ll be faced with balancing essential requirements such as education, water electricity, police, fire fighting, healthcare and much more along with your citys real economy system. Citizens within your city react fluidly, with gravitas and with an air of authenticity to a multitude of game play scenarios.Extensive local traffic simulationColossal Order's extensive experience developing the Cities in Motion series is fully utilized in a fully fleshed out and well-crafted local traffic simulation.Districts and PoliciesBe more than just an administrator from city hall. Designating parts of your city as a district results in the application of policies which results in you rising to the status of Mayor for your own city.Utilize the Day and Night CycleThe city changes during the hours of the day and affects citizen schedules. Traffic is visibly slower at night and some zoned areas do not work with full efficiency. This expansion will put you in control of managing the different aspects of the day and night cycles.Extensive modding supportBuild or improve on existing maps and structures.

       "  'full_bio': \"RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune.You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world.Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions.Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more.Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses.Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others.Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines.Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials.Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.Trade with passing ships and caravans.Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony.Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires.Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery.Discover a new generated world each time you play.Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop.Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor.RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active mod community. Read more at http://rimworldgame.com.(All non-English translations are made by fans.)\",\n",

Choose from four unique, varied factions and wage war your way – mounting a campaign of conquest to save or destroy a vast and vivid fantasy world.  This is a game of two halves – one a turn-based open-world campaign, and the other intense, tactical real-time battles across the fantastical landscapes of the New World.Play how you choose – delve into a deep engrossing campaign, experience unlimited replayability and challenge the world in multiplayer with a custom army of your favourite units. Total War: WARHAMMER II offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and no two games are the same. World-Spanning ConquestEngage in statecraft, diplomacy, exploration and build your empire, turn by turn. Capture, build and manage teeming settlements and recruit vast armies. Level up Legendary Lords and Heroes and arm them with mythical weapons and armour. Negotiate alliances or declare Total War to subjugate any that stand between you and your goal. Epic Real-Time BattlesCommand thousands-strong legions of soldiers in intense tactical battles. Send forth ferocious, twisted monsters, fire-breathing dragons and harness powerful magic. Utilise military strategies, lay ambushes, or use brute force to turn the tide of combat and lead your forces to victory.The second in a trilogy and sequel to the award-winning Total War: WARHAMMER, Total War: WARHAMMER II brings players a breath-taking new narrative campaign, set across the vast continents of Lustria, Ulthuan, Naggaroth and the Southlands. The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike any other Total War title to date.Playing as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races. Each Legendary Lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics, narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, Lores of Magic, legendary characters, and staggering new battlefield army abilities.Shortly after launch, owners of both the original game and Total War™ WARHAMMER II will gain access to the colossal third campaign. Exploring a single open-world epic map covering the Old World and the New World, players may embark on monumental campaigns as any owned Race from both titles.Conquer the world, togetherEach of the Races in Total War™ WARHAMMER II will be playable in single and multiplayer campaign, plus custom and multiplayer battles. As the two Legendary Lords for each race all have their own unique campaign start positions, you’ll be able to play a 2-player co-op campaign as the same race. If you own both parts 1 and 2, you’ll be able to play in multiplayer as any of the races you own.  The World of Total War: WARHAMMER IIMillennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin.Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent.Atop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail. The Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex – and great opportunity in its demise.Meanwhile the Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, stir in their foetid subterranean tunnels. There they multiply unchecked and look hungrily towards the surface, their motives obscured. The time for revelation is nigh…Four races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill.',\n",

Toss a bottle through a window to distract an enemy. Rip a Headcrab off your face and throw it out the window.COMMUNITY-BUILT ENVIRONMENTSA set of Source 2 tools for building new levels is included with the game, enabling any player to build and contribute new environments for the community to enjoy through Half-Life: Alyx's Steam Workshop.

The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands?Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear.Key FeaturesRob Banks, Get Paid – Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side.CRIMENET – The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician \"The Elephant\", and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind.PAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level – Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good.Dynamic Scenarios – No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events.Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister.More Masks than Ever – PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations.  Weapons and Modifications – A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you\\'ve settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine?Play It Your Way – Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes or running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, each approach will provide a different experience.A Long History of Additional Content – More than 70 updates since release, including new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts.',\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"BeamNG.drive is a realistic, immersive driving game offering near-limitless possibilities. Our soft-body physics engine simulates every component of a vehicle in real time, resulting in realistic, dynamic behavior.                                        The driving feel is authentic and visceral, and crashes are realistic and violent; yet the physics are accessible enough to drive with a keyboard or gamepad while still being authentic with a full racing wheel with uncompromising realism.Environments and vehicles in BeamNG.drive are hand-crafted with passionate attention to detail. With years of meticulous design, research, and experience, we authentically recreate the feeling and excitement of real world driving.We are a small team from around the world with no obligations to publishers or outside interests. Our users and modding community are our first priority. Help us make BeamNG.drive the ultimate driving experience and discover what an open and uncompromising soft-body vehicle simulator can be.Why is BeamNG.drive the game for you?As an open world vehicle simulator, BeamNG.drive will cover a large array of vehicular disciplines - everything from a delivery mission in a box truck to a high speed rally race or a destruction derby. The vehicle customization and detail will allow you to make your car or truck all your own - fix it up, upgrade it, or strip away body panels to reduce weight. There are a lot of different types of gameplay we want to implement beyond just racing and crashing, such as police chases, stunt challenges, and other specialized minigames. Eventually we would like to have some kind of single player open world career mode, with persistent vehicle ownership and procedurally generated used vehicles to buy and events to run them in.In some ways, BeamNG.drive is about doing anything you want with a car or truck - the stuff other games don't let you do. You can go off-roading in a family sedan or hurl a delivery truck around a racing circuit, all with beautiful soft-body simulation physics. You can mod those same vehicles to be racing beasts, derby monsters, or off-road behemoths - or just thrash them stock. At the end of the day, BeamNG.drive gives you the gameplay you want, and doesn't force you to do anything that you don't think is fun or interesting.The future of the game and our physics engineAs we optimize our game and computer technology improves, the amount of vehicles which can be simultaneously simulated at a smooth framerate will increase. Right now you can run 4 to 6 cars at one time on a high end quad-core processor. Each vehicle has around 400 nodes and 4000 beams, all being simulated 2000 times per second. We hope to expand the number of simultaneous vehicles possible to at least 8 with a mid-range processor.We will also look towards having multiplayer in the future, but it may be some time before we can create the multiplayer experience everyone is expecting. We are well aware of the demand for multiplayer and we want it just as much as you, but for the short term we are focusing on the single player career mode, various driving events, fixing bugs, and creating more content. It is feasible that we could implement local and/or same PC multiplayer in the interim.Also, the possibilities extend beyond land vehicles. Users in our community have already made planes and helicopters that fly purely with the existing vehicle aerodynamic physics, with no cheating whatsoever. BeamNG can simulate aircraft in a very authentic way due to its soft-body physics. All the flex that happens to a real plane's airframe arises naturally in BeamNG, and the consequences of excessive stress are also modeled. Fly too fast and your wings will start to bend and rip off. The potential for the BeamNG physics engine is huge.Alpha Access Features    All future updates to BeamNG.drive included for free (alpha, beta), also including the final game    Soft-body physics sandbox    19 detailed, customizable, destructible vehicles, with more to come    10 terrains to explore and drive across, with more to come    Frequent updates adding terrains, vehicles, features, gameplay, and bug fixes    Full modding and content creation capabilities - make maps and vehicles, and script gameplay    Use the built-in terrain editor and any 3D modeling, image editing, and text editing software    Online authentication is only necessary to update; the game itself does not need an internet connection to run.Alpha TestersUsers that already entered the alpha testing via our website can get a free Steam key.Our goalsOur main focus is on how things move rather than how things look on the screen. We aim to bring our expertise in real time soft-body physics and soft-body physics model design to the forefront of game physics simulation, making available the technology and know-how to as a wide an audience as possible. To achieve this, we are designing the engine and corresponding assets, so as to be independent of the underlying game engine and operating system.Right now the physics engine is running on a multicore CPU configuration, but we are also in the process of supporting GPUs via OpenCL.Our missionTo have realistic, accurate, destructible, and malleable physics everywhere. To make anything possible.More FeedbackMore Feedback can be found there: http://www.beamng.com/content/119-FeedbackContact UsYou can get in touch with us in several ways:     Use our forums: http://www.beamng.com/forum/     Via email: http://www.beamng.com/contactus/ or support@beamng.com     Follow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/beamng     Subscribe to our YouTube channel: http://youtube.com/user/beamng     Visit our Facebook page: http://facebook.com/BeamNGPhysics\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"Savage, nightmarish monsters roam the Louisiana swamps, and you are part of a group of rugged bounty hunters bound to rid the world of their ghastly presence. Banish these creatures from our world, and you will be paid generously—and given the chance to buy more gruesome and powerful weapons. Fail, and death will strip you of both character and gear. Your experience, however, remains in your pool of hunters—called your Bloodline—always.HIGH RISK, HIGH REWARD, HIGH TENSIONHunt’s competitive, match-based gameplay mixes PvP and PvE elements to create a uniquely tense experience where your life, your character, and your gear are always on the line. At the beginning of each Bounty Hunt match, up to 12 players set out to track their monstrous targets. Depending on which mode and team options you’ve chosen, that 12 will include a combination of solo players and teams of two or three. Once they’ve found and defeated one of these they will receive a bounty—and instantly become a target for every other Hunter left on the map. If you don’t watch your back, you’ll find a knife in it, and your last memory will be of someone else walking away with your prize. The higher the risk, the higher the reward–but a single mistake could cost you everything.Hunt's Quick Play game mode offers a shorter match, during which up to ten individual players race to scavenge gear and find and close four rifts as they compete for a diminishing pool of bounty. First Hunter to the final rift absorbs its energy, but must survive the final count down to complete the mission—while the other Hunters attempt to take them out and take the prize for themselves. When the timer runs out the winner keeps their Hunter, while the rest perish.PROGRESSIONEven in death, you will be able to progress among the ranks of Hunters via your Bloodline. Though one character may die, their experience will be transferred to your Bloodline, where it can be applied your other Hunters. If you make it off of the map alive, you will be able to use the money and experience you earn to kit out new Hunters and prepare for the next match. If you die, you lose everything but your experience.DARK SIGHTDark Sight allows Hunters to see into the veil between worlds, making that which cannot be seen by mortal eyes visible to those who have been initiated. Use Dark Sight when you are tracking monsters, and a ghostly light will guide you toward your next target. Dark Sight also marks players carrying a bounty, making them more vulnerable to ambush while trying to escape.\",\n",

A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you!Dive Into a Vast Underwater WorldYou have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica's oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful.Scavenge, Craft, and SurviveAfter crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items.Construct Underwater HabitatsBuild bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean.Unravel the MysteryWhat happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive?Disrupt the Food ChainThe ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators.Handle the PressureBuild a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more.Fear the NightAs the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see.Dive Below the Ocean FloorCave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.Open DevelopmentGet weekly or daily updates, see what the development team is working on, view real time change logs, and give feedback from inside the game.

To do so, you’ll need to survive the harsh wilderness and the threat of rival nations… as well as threats within your own court.Customize your character with a wide range of classes and powers including specialized archetypes, powerful arcane and divine spells, choosing from a multitude of class abilities, skills, and feats. Pathfinder allows players to create heroes (or villains) that fit both their individual gameplay styles and their personalities.Meet a diverse cast of companions and NPCs, including iconic characters from the Pathfinder setting itself. You’ll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours. Your journey will become their journey, and you’ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future.Conquer new regions as claim them as your own, carving your kingdom from the wilderness. While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and kingdom development are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins — and while dealing with politics in your own court. Your kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with. As your kingdom grows, a number of factions and neighboring countries will come to you to seek favor—and to test your strength.Explore - Conquer - Rule!The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is an evolution of the 3.5 rules set of the world's oldest fantasy roleplaying game, designed by Paizo, Inc using the feedback of tens of thousands of gamers just like you. Whether you’re new to the Pathfinder® universe or you’re a seasoned veteran, Pathfinder: Kingmaker is the CRPG you’ve been waiting for.\",\n",

It’s a place where the right kind of person with the right kind of weaponry can really make a name for themselves, and make more than an enemy or two along the way.As you battle your way across the heat-blasted Mojave Wasteland, the colossal Hoover Dam, and the neon drenched Vegas Strip, you’ll be introduced to a colorful cast of characters, power-hungry factions, special weapons, mutated creatures and much more. Choose sides in the upcoming war or declare “winner takes all” and crown yourself the King of New Vegas in this follow-up to the 2008 videogame of the year, Fallout 3.Enjoy your stay.Key FeaturesFeel the Heat in New Vegas!

Their honor-bound culture wields hyper-advanced technology, while bowing to the ancient traditions of kings and queens.Colonists can complete quests to earn honor with the Empire. Honor brings Imperial titles like acolyte, knight, and baron. Build grand throne rooms for your noble as they rise through the royal ranks. Dress them in finery fit for a monarch, or the prestige armor of a great warrior. They'll make speeches from the throne, inspiring your people, and play piano, harp, and harpsichord.Each title allows you to choose or upgrade an Imperial permit:Imperial troopers, janissaries, and cataphracts drop in to fight for you in times of need. Orbital strikes and orbital salvoes blast your foes from above.Shuttles take you where you want to go.Labor teams help when you are shorthanded.There are multiple ways to develop psychic powers. Those who gain Imperial titles receive powers from the ceremonial Imperial bestower. Tribal colonists can commune with the mysterious anima tree to build their psychic link. Or, you can fight the Empire using stolen psychic technology acquired through quests.There are a wide variety of psychic powers. Some are made for combat:Skip, chaos skip, mass chaos skip, chunk skip, and wallraise move people and objects across distances to gain tactical advantage. Extract wounded allies, cross no man's land, pull enemies into melee brawls, shift cover where you want it.Painblock and focus modify the mind for combat.Blinding pulse and vertigo pulse blind your enemies or force them to vomit uncontrollably.Neuroquake overloads every conscious being on the map in a huge wave of psychic energy.Berserk, berserk pulse, and manhunter pulse drive people and animals momentarily insane.Invisibility prevents your colonist from being seen during stealth approaches or escapes.Burden and stun slow and halt your foes.Smokepop blocks line of sight.Farskip moves a group of your people across the world.Bullet shield creates a small temporary safe zone for attack or retreat.Flashstorm calls down a storm of lightning.Waterskip showers fires with extinguishing water.Beckon mind-controls foes into approaching you.Neural heat dump moves neural heat to an ally so you can keep casting.Others powers are useful for community management:Solar pinhole creates a long-lasting source of light and heat.Word of trust helps recruitment.Word of joy makes people happy.Word of love induces romantic attraction.Word of serenity ends mental breaks.Word of inspiration confers creative energy.Psychic powers require psychic meditation. Each colonist meditates differently, depending on their title, backstory, and traits:Titled colonists meditate on their thrones according to Imperial tradition.Tribal colonists meditate directly in nature, to the anima tree itself or to constructed shrines or ancient stones.Morbid colonists with psychopath, cannibal, or bloodlust traits meditate to graves. It's more effective when the grave has a related person in it.Ascetic colonists meditate to blank walls.Pyromaniac colonists meditate to flame shrines made of braziers, torches, and campfires.Everyone can also meditate to sculptures.This expansion adds a large variety of quest content. Since RimWorld is a story-generation game, quests aren't fixed like in other games. Instead, the system procedurally generates unique quests with every new game. Different goals, foes, guests, rewards, helpers, special threats, and world conditions combine to create endless varied stories and challenges. Quest givers may even provide special helpers during the quest - for example, a quest may ask you to fight a huge mechanoid cluster, but also include help from elite Imperial cataphracts to make the battle winnable.Quests will reward you with Imperial titles, new allies, unique implants, archotechnological artifacts, gear, faction goodwill, and more.Imperial hospitality quests ask the player to host a group of Imperials. The guests may be injured or healthy, useful allies or helpless burdens, single or numerous. They may be hunted by mercenaries, pirates, mechanoids, or more. You might need to get the guests to an escape shuttle under fire.Refugee hospitality quests present a group of impoverished travelers asking for help. There are many outcomes. They may reward you later for your help, or betray you in the middle of the night. A third party may make you an offer to betray them. If you treat them well, they may spontaneously offer to join you. Since they have no faction, you can treat them with kindness or brutality.Animal hospitality quests see you caring for a group of animals struck with sickness or hunted by enemies.Prisoner hospitality quests ask you to keep prisoners under guard.Shuttle crash quests begin with a shuttle crashlanded near your colony, under attack by enemies. Quickly assemble a defense around the shuttle and help its defenders drive off the attackers while keeping the civilians safe, until the rescue shuttle extracts them.Monument quests ask the player to build a grand monument, and sometimes, to protect it from attacks.Aerial assault quests have you supply troops for an ally's airborne assault against a rival faction. A shuttle takes your troops into combat and extracts them.Colonist lending quests ask you to send some of your colonists to help an ally, leaving you to run the colony shorthanded.Mechanoid cluster quests threaten you with a mechanoid cluster at your colony, or at a site nearby, in exchange for a reward.Other quests quests present special combinations of raids, animal attacks, insect infestations, atmospheric effects, weather, and more, in exchange for rewards.A new endgame quest comes after you have climbed the ranks of Imperial nobility. Host the Imperial High Stellarch and his elite Stellic Guards in your luxurious court, protect them from their enemies, and be invited to leave the rimworld as an honored Imperial guest.Mechanoids can now create mechanoid clusters - groups of new mechanoid buildings which work together to present a unique tactical challenge.Mech clusters always appear in an initially dormant state. The player can take the time to decide and execute a plan of attack. This puts the player on the offensive, which contrasts with the defense-oriented fights in the base game. Mech cluster elements include:World condition makers that poison the air, darken the sky, or create some other world condition.Shields to block bullets or mortar fireFactories to assemble new mechanoids over time.Beacons to call reinforcements.Turrets, mortars, and surrounding walls.Unstable power units which you can attack to create explosions, or steal.Alarm systems of various types.Mechanoid defenders including the new Pikeman sniper mech.Gloomlight units provide an extra reward if you eliminate the cluster with precision.Each mech cluster generates with a unique layout, presenting a unique tactical puzzle. Some of them will require a frontal assault. Others may be susceptible to mortar bombardment. You may be able to plant explosives inside the cluster before waking it up.

       "  'full_bio': 'About This ContentIn Gathering Storm, the second expansion to Civilization VI, the world around you is more alive than ever before. Chart a path to victory for your people by developing new advanced technologies and engineering projects and negotiating with the global community in the World Congress on critical issues. The choices you make in the game will influence the world ecosystem and could impact the future of the entire planet. Natural disasters like floods, storms, and volcanoes can pillage or destroy your Improvements and Districts – but they may also refresh and enrich the lands after they pass.In addition to these new systems, Civilization VI: Gathering Storm introduces eight new civilizations and nine new leaders. Seven new world wonders can be constructed, as well as a variety of new units, districts, buildings, and improvements.ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTSVolcanoes, storms (blizzards, sand storms, tornados, hurricanes), climate change, floods, and droughts.POWER AND CONSUMABLE RESOURCESStrategic resources play an additional role in Gathering Storm. These resources are now consumed in power plants to generate electricity for your cities. Initially you’ll be powering your most advanced buildings by burning carbon-based resources like Coal and Oil, but renewable energy sources also unlock as you progress to current-day technologies. Your choices about resource usage will directly affect the world’s temperature and can cause melting ice caps and rising sea levels.ENGINEERING PROJECTSShape the world around your empire to overcome unfavorable land conditions by making improvements like canals, dams, tunnels and railroads. When settling cities, consider the flood risk to coastal lowland areas, but keep in mind that in the late-game, new technologies like Flood Barriers can be used to protect these tiles.WORLD CONGRESSMake your voice heard among the other leaders of the world. Earn Diplomatic Favor through Alliances, influencing city-states, competing in World Games, and more. Use Diplomatic Favor to extract promises from other leaders, vote on Resolutions, call a Special Session to address an emergency, and increase the weight of your votes in your quest to achieve the new Diplomatic Victory.21st CENTURY TECHNOLOGIES & CIVICSA new era has been added to the Technology and Civics trees. Combat new environmental effects with speculative ideas such as relocating your population out to seasteads and developing technologies to recapture carbon emissions.NEW LEADERS AND CIVSNine new leaders from eight new civilizations are introduced. Each brings unique bonuses and gameplay, as well as a total of nine unique units, four unique buildings, three unique improvements, two unique districts and one unique governor.NEW SCENARIOSThe Black Death: The Black Death ravaged Europe and western Asia in the mid-14th century, killing a greater share of the population than any other event in world history. The pandemic killed millions, ruined economies, upended political dynasties and transformed the face of the Western world. Your task is to lead your nation through the calamity: keep your population alive, your economy strong, and your faith unshaken amidst a world of terror and desperation. War Machine: At the outset of WWI, the German Imperial Army had a daring plan: invade neutral Belgium and then rush the French heartland before they could mobilize to resist. If successful, the German forces would capture Paris within a month and end their resistance forever. In counter, the French command prepared Plan 17, an all-out onslaught designed to meet and stop a German offensive. When war was declared, both armies swung into motion and set up one of the most incredible and shocking military campaigns in world history. In this multiplayer scenario, players take the side of one of these two great powers at this same precipice. As Germany, your task is to capture Paris. As France, your task is to prevent its capture. The clock is ticking, and the enemy is moving. Advance!MORE NEW CONTENTSeven new world wonders, seven natural wonders, 18 new units, 15 new improvements, 9 new buildings, 5 new districts, 2 new city sets, 9 new techs and 10 new civics have been added.IMPROVED GAMEPLAY SYSTEMSThe Espionage system has been enhanced with new options, the Culture and Science Victories have been updated, new Historic Moments have been added, and additional improvements have been made to other existing systems.',\n",

Up to 60 players on a server will be tasked with a single goal: survive this new unfamiliar land for as long as possible, by any means necessary.Key FeaturesNew massive world to explore. At 163 km², Livonia is big enough to provide you with hours of exploration as you learn the lay of the land. Its varied landscapes and numerous landmarks provide an abundance of places for players to take shelter, build a base, and hide from both the infected and other survivors.Idyllic environment. This Eastern European terrain covers the southern Topolin-Nadbór region of the larger Polish-speaking country of Livonia. The new topography brings lush green landscapes, dense forests, overgrown fields, winding rivers, serene lakes, murky swamps, an array of dilapidated structures, and various remnants of an abandoned society.Frequent Encounters. The new map is the perfect size for survivors looking for player-interactions. Whether friendly or hostile, you'll stumble upon other players much more often in Livonia.Fresh hunting ground. Livonia's food supply is scarce, and players wanting to survive will have to quickly learn how to forage, fish, and hunt in this new wilderness to keep from starving. Luckily, Livonia is home to a plethora of wildlife for survivors to live off. But beware: alongside this delicious fauna a new threat roams the post-apocalyptic world of DayZ, and it comes in the form of the Eurasian Brown Bear. Watch out!Erratic weather. The temperate late-summer climate of Livonia, although usually quite pleasant, brings frequent rainfall and severe thunderstorms. This unpredictable and relentless weather will pose an additional challenge for survivors, as you’ll have to keep a keen eye open for protective gear and shelter to shield yourself from the unforgiving elements.\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': 'The world’s unquenchable need for entertainment has turned towards bloodlust as entertainment behemoth TEC1 is set to premiere season two of its television sensation SCUM. This new season moves the contest from the rugged, enclosed indoor arenas to the lush forests, rolling fields, and rugged terrains of TEC1’’s own private SCUM Island. Both fan favorites and new prisoners will clash in a ruthless war of survival while battling for the support of viewers, producers, and corporate sponsors for fame, gifts, and a chance of life after death.SCUM aims to evolve the multiplayer open world survival game with unprecedented levels of character customization, control and progression, where knowledge and skills are the ultimate weapons for long-term survival. Combining the methodical planning and management of hardcore survival with optional PvP ‘network events’ available to everyone at anytime, SCUM strikes a unique balance between complex simulation and intense action in the next generation of survival game. SCUM is built with Unreal Engine 4 and will expand throughout the Early Access period. Fans can follow details on development with weekly dev blogs on scumgame.com and on Twitter @SCUMgame.FEATURES [ALPHA]Complex Simulation: SCUM utilizes dozens of complex systems to allow players to go as deep as they choose into the management of their character. Players can delve into the minutia of the survival experience through systems controlling their character’s metabolism, inertia during movement, and even how fast layers of clothing dry on and off the body. The devil is in the details...Massive Landscape: Traverse and explore 144 sq km of terrain that includes dense forests, picturesque beaches, serene fields, abandoned towns, and rundown airfields. Initially, the massive terrain will be handled by foot and as development continues vehicles will be introduced for quicker movement.PvP Network Events: Enter TEC1’s ongoing network events with a click of a button and be whisked to enclosed areas of the island for white-knuckle PvP gameplay. Volunteer for an event and be pitted against other prisoners with fame points and high value loot on the line for those that survive.Expanding Gameplay: While the current version of SCUM already includes basic crafting, combat, and customization systems, the featureset and gameplay will continually expand to include more advanced mechanics, more variety in gameplay, and a metanarrative for players to complete missions with hopes of one day getting off the island...Online Multiplayer: Survive with up to 64 players per server with the option to rent your own server right from the in-game menu.

Those who did not die in the first few days, were plagued by hallucinations and headaches, many people went mad, others and committed suicide. The source of the disease could not be detected but the cities that were once the vibrant social and economic beacons of humanity were left ravaged and deserted.Survivors gradually began to change — after fifteen years of transformation, the changes became visible. The most noticeable metamorphosis occurred in the eyes of the affected — some began to glow, while others resembled black holes. To hide their unnatural looks and conceal the mutation, people started wearing padded clothing and sunglasses.Twenty years have passed after ‘Crossout’. Humans still remember their life before the disaster. As always, there are groups trying to recover the old world, while others enjoy the chaos and destruction. But there are those who are not human any more. They hide their faces behind masks, and their motives are unknown.\",\n",

With this pass, you’ll be granted access to all upcoming game content in this season, including immediate access to THE RIFTS and two major expansions coming in 2020.CLICK FOR MORE SEASON PASS INFOTHE CITY MUST SURVIVEFrostpunk, the newest title from the creators of This War of Mine, is a society survival game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process?MAKE THE LAWEstablish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.SHAPE YOUR SOCIETYIf you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back.WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICESSome of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIESSurvival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.EXPLORE THE FROSTLANDWhile New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.PLAY ENDLESSLYFrostpunk’s Endless Mode is the latest, longly awaited update requested by our community. It’s the biggest DLC to the game so far, offering new maps, game modes, mechanics, and it will allow you to dive into the Frostpunk experience deeper than ever before. ',\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"About This SoftwarePC gaming is a quest for performance, a never-ending cycle of upgrading, overclocking, and tweaking your system for faster frame rates, higher resolutions, and better quality visual effects.3DMark is essential equipment for this quest. For more than 20 years, 3DMark has been the first choice for benchmarking, testing, and comparing PC performance.There'll always be a new game that demands more performance from your hardware. And there'll always be new hardware that delivers more performance for your games. And so the cycle continues. Welcome to 3DMark, the Gamer's Benchmark.3DMark includes everything gamers need to benchmark and compare PC performance. It has dedicated tests for all types of PC from lightweight laptops to dedicated desktops. 3DMark will recommend the best benchmark for your hardware.3DMark tests your system's GPU and CPU performance by rendering extremely demanding game-like scenes in real time. The faster the benchmark runs, the better your score. Now your quest begins. What can you do to get a better score?Start by comparing your 3DMark score with results from other systems with the same hardware. Lower than average scores may indicate a problem with cooling, configuration, or faulty components. Higher than average scores show the potential for overclocking your hardware.Update your drivers. Update Windows. Experiment with system settings. See how much more performance you can get from your system. Run 3DMark after every change to track your progress. Identify bottlenecks in your system and compare 3DMark scores to help choose your next upgrade. Ask for advice, share tips, and show off your system in the 3DMark Community Hub on Steam.Overclocking is an art that takes skill and precision. The goal is to squeeze every drop of performance out of your GPU and CPU. The reward is a free performance upgrade and the satisfaction of pushing your hardware beyond its stock performance.3DMark is an essential tool for overclockers. Run 3DMark before and after overclocking to measure the performance gain. Use custom benchmark settings to explore your PC's performance limits. Make 3DMark tests more or less demanding by changing the resolution and other settings.Run 3DMark Stress Tests to check the stability of your overclocks and the effectiveness of your cooling. 3DMark Stress Tests run in a loop to put your system under heavy load for longer than a standard benchmark run.Challenge your friends to set the highest 3DMark score or compete for the top spot in the 3DMark Steam leaderboards.If you love PC gaming, there's nothing better than building your own custom PC. And if you build it yourself, there's nothing more nerve-racking than turning it on for the first time. Will it boot? Will everything work properly? Whether you're building a complete system from scratch or upgrading a component, 3DMark has you covered.Run 3DMark and compare your benchmark score with similar systems to make sure your new build is set up correctly. Detailed hardware monitoring charts show you how the CPU and GPU load, temperature, and clock speed changed during your benchmark run—ideal for identifying configuration issues.Use 3DMark Stress Tests to check the stability of your system and discover faulty hardware while it's still under warranty. Stress testing is also a great way to test and optimize your system's cooling performance. A well-built PC with decent cooling should be able to deliver peak performance for the full duration of a 3DMark Stress Test.3DMark can help when you are planning an upgrade as well. Search and compare benchmark results from all the latest graphics cards and processors on the 3DMark website to find the models that offer the best performance for your budget.PC gaming never stands still and neither does 3DMark. Every year, we add new benchmarks, tests, and features. We update 3DMark regularly so that you can benchmark the latest PC gaming hardware. When you buy 3DMark today, you benefit from over seven years of continuous development, updates, and enhancements.BenchmarksTime Spy — DirectX 12 benchmark for gaming PCsTime Spy Extreme — 4K gaming benchmark with DirectX 12Port Royal — Real-time ray tracing benchmark Night Raid — DirectX 12 test for PCs with integrated graphics Wild Life — Cross-platform benchmark for notebooks and tabletsFire Strike — DirectX 11 benchmark for gaming PCs Fire Strike Extreme — DirectX 11 benchmark for gaming PCsFire Strike Ultra — 4K gaming with DirectX 11Sky Diver — DirectX 11 test for PCs with integrated graphicsStress Tests — Test the reliability and stability of your PC Feature testsAPI Overhead feature testPCI Express feature testVRS feature testNVIDIA DLSS feature testFeaturesHardware monitoringCustom benchmark settingsInstall tests independentlySkip benchmark demo optionSave results offlineTest your PC with Time Spy, Night Raid, Fire Strike, and Sky Diver.Other benchmarks, features, and settings are locked.\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': 'Battle Brothers is a turn based tactical RPG which has you leading a mercenary company in a gritty, low-power, medieval fantasy world. You decide where to go, whom to hire or to fight, what contracts to take and how to train and equip your men in a procedurally generated open world campaign. Do you have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory?The game consists of a strategic worldmap and a tactical combat layer. On the worldmap you can freely travel in order to take contracts that earn you good coin, find places worth looting, enemies worth pursuing or towns to resupply and hire men at. This is also where you manage, level up and equip your Battle Brothers. Once you engage a hostile party the game will switch to a tactical map where the actual fighting takes place as detailed turn based combat. Manage a medieval mercenary company in a procedurally generated open world. Fight complex turn-based tactical battles with historical equipment and brutal injuries. Permadeath. All characters that die in combat will stay dead – unless they return as the undead. All characters come with their own background stories and traits. Want a stuttering ratcatcher, a greedy witch hunter or a drunkard disowned noble? Character development without a restrictive class-system. Each character gains experience through combat, can level up and acquire powerful perks. Equipment that matters. Different weapons grant unique skills – split shields with axes, stun enemies with maces, form a spearwall with spears or crush armor with a warhammer. Diverse enemy roster. All enemies have unique equipment, skills and AI behavior. A dynamic event system with atmospheric encounters and tough decisions outside of combat. Three late game crises – a war between noble houses, a greenskin invasion and an undead scourge – add a looming threat. Two full hours of orchestral soundtrack. 70 Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards.Overhype Studios is an independent game developer studio from Hamburg, Germany. We are devoted to making great games that we want to play ourselves. With Battle Brothers we strive to reflect the creativity, complexity and originality from the old days when game developers were passionate gamers, not corporate businessmen. While doing this we took a lot of inspiration from some of the best games out there: The original X-Com, Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat and Jagged Alliance.',\n",

       "  'full_bio': \" PlanetSide 2 is a free-to-play, massively multiplayer online first person shooter (MMOFPS).  Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.THREE WARRING EMPIRES Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.MASSIVE WARFARE Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.ENORMOUS MAPS PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings. PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS In PlanetSide 2 the war isn’t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle.CLASS-BASED COMBATPlayers can build their soldier to match wants and their allies' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more.Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis.Light Assault: Go where the Heavies can’t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes!Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper's nest. You are the enemy's constant fear. Engineer:  Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death.OUTFIT TEAMWORK Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire's strategic organization. VEHICLES & WEAPONSTrain and equip your solider how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.PLAY FOR FREE \",\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"Rogue Legacy is back! But now it's got a 2 in front of it!Rogue Legacy 2 is a genealogical rogue-LITE. That means it has all the trappings of a typical rogue-like (randomized runs, changing characters, and more), but with persistent upgrades, and persistent dead heirs.  In this game, your legacy defines you.  Spend your parents’ inheritance and grow the family manor to give your children a better fighting chance.  Each child is unique, with their own traits and abilities.  Your daughter could be an archer.  She could also be a Vegan.  Rogue Legacy 2 also lets you play how you want to.  Go hard and fast, and you can dive deeper into the depths of a randomly-generated world.  Or take it slow and steady, and build your character up until you’re ready for greater challenges.  Haven’t played the first one?  In that case, here's what (the original) Rogue Legacy IS ALL ABOUT:An adventure that takes place in a randomly generated world. The entire kingdom changes with every life, so no two runs are the same.Rogue-LITE. This is not your average roguelike because even in death, not all is lost.  Instead, you can build your manor, improve your legacy through an in-depth skill tree, and make each child stronger than the last. The game can be beaten at level 1, but that doesn't mean it has to.Every heir is unique. Some might have Synethesia, where sounds can be perceived as colours, others might be contrary pacifists, and some could just be a little chubby. Equip your heroes with powerful weaponry and armor. Or gain new abilities like flight, dash, and air jumping.Clowns.That’s fine and dandy, but what about the sequel?  Here’s what’s NEW with Rogue Legacy TWO:Brand New StyleWe’re taking a whole new artistic approach to Rogue Legacy 2. The sequel features 2.5D stylings, with 3D characters against hand-drawn backdrops.  The art uses heavy shading and all animations are done using stepping techniques to keep the familiar RL look and feel.Unique WeaponsOn top of new abilities, classes now have weapons that completely alter how they play.  Rangers use bows, Lancers have multi-directional swings, and chefs throws ladles.Revamped Biome GenerationWe went all-out with biome generation to make each area in RL2 feel completely new.  Each biome adopts different “build strategies” to create completely unique yet-still-randomly-generated regions.True MetroidvaniaTo really push the metroidvania flair, RL2 introduces heirlooms: special items that permanently give your heroes new abilities that fully reveal the world’s secrets.  These are not basic lock-in-key abilities, but powers that fundamentally change how you play.  And heirlooms are not simply handed to you.  You must prove your worth, provided you can find them.Traits 2.0Through the powers of Socialism we’re bringing in the Universal Healthcare System, which adds a gold gain modifier to some traits.  The more debilitating the trait is (in-game), the bigger the reward.  This makes choosing your heirs a meaningful decision every time.Improved AccessibilityRL1 was always designed for accessibility, by catering to both the hardcore players through skilled gameplay, and the more casual with a detailed level up system.  However, in some cases progression could still hit a wall, so we’ve introduced new mechanics such as Off-shore Banking to give struggling players more ways to succeed.More of everythingOf course we’re also adding more of everything people loved from the original Rogue Legacy.  More traits, more spells, more classes, more biomes, more enemies, more equipment, more rooms, more story.  Just more everything.ClownathropyMore clown.AND THERE'S A WHOLE LOT MORE. But we're still working on them through Early Access, and we'd like to keep a few secrets in our back pocket. :)Early Access may be temporary, but Rogue Legacy is forever!\",\n",

It is a game of murder, accusations, deceit and mob hysteria. How To Play The game ranges from 7 to 15 players. These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, Mafia, Serial Killers, Arsonists and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they kill you. The catch? You don't know who is a Town member and who is a villain. If you are an evil role, such as a Serial Killer, you secretly murder town members in the veil of night and try to avoid getting caught. RolesTown of Salem has 33 unique roles ensuring a different experience each time you play. Before a game starts, players are put into a lobby where the host can select what roles will be in the game. Players are then assigned roles at random from the list of chosen roles. Players have an in-game role card that explains their role's abilities and alignments.

       "  'full_bio': 'About This ContentContinue your quest for ultimate survival and unlock a whole new chapter in the saga of ARK: Survival Evolved with the ARK: Genesis Season Pass! This Season Pass gives you access to two new huge expansion packs, and one exclusive in-game robotic AI companion called ‘HLN-A’. In ARK: Genesis, further the ARK storyline while adventuring through exotic new worlds with all-new mission-based gameplay. Discover, utilize and master new creatures, new craftable items, weapons, and structures unlike anything you have seen yet!The Genesis Season Pass includes:- ARK: Genesis Part 1 (available February 25, 2020) - ARK: Genesis Part 2 (available March 2021) - Exclusive HLN-A cosmetic pet (available right now!)The massive “ARK: Genesis Part 1” expansion includes:Waking up within a virtual simulation, you must survive in a world unlike anything you’ve seen before! ARK: Genesis represents a new, story-oriented beginning in ARK’s epic saga of survival. With a strangely familiar companion, you must overcome the simulation’s rigorous tests. Only by fighting, building, taming, and exploring will you uncover the secrets behind this forbidding place.CONQUER EVERY MISSIONA holographic guide to the simulation, HLN-A, offers a wide array of missions at varying difficulty levels, for you to tackle at your own pace — everything from gunning down waves of enemies with the aid of power-ups, escorting vulnerable baby creatures to their parents, tracking and hunting down powerful bosses, competing in Dino Races, even playing a round of Dodo-Basketball, and much more. The simulation itself isn’t perfect, so you can earn extra credit (and experience) by fixing the glitches scattered all throughout the world. Completing missions earns you Hexagons, which you can spend for extra resources, TEK items, and more.EXPLORE LETHAL LANDSCAPES ARK: Genesis features beautiful biomes ripe for exploration — but they all want you dead. The simulator tests your mettle across fetid alien bogs, deep undersea trenches, frigid mountain peaks, dangerous volcanic hellscapes… and even the wild low-gravity surface of an alien moon. Conquering each area requires preparation, smarts, and the ability to improvise so that when a volcano rains fire from the sky, an avalanche buries you, or a whirlpool pulls you into the briny deep, you’re ready to meet the challenge! HUNT AND TAME NEW CREATURESThe environments may be dangerous, but they’re nothing compared to the new creatures who call ARK: Genesis home: web-spinning spiderlike beasts, cute-but-deadly shapeshifters, sea turtles the size of islands, and lava lizards that act as living forges. Plus, who doesn’t want to fly around on an immense hyperspace-capable space whale? Master the simulation, and you can test yourself against a mysterious new boss… the likes of which ARK has never seen before.GEAR UP AND BUILD UPAs you brave the many dangers of ARK: Genesis, take some time to craft new gear. Wield weapons like combo-capable plasma claws and remote-guided cruise missiles. Make tools from fishing nets to mining drills, or new vehicles such as hover-skiffs. Build interactive structural elements such as pressure plates, alarm systems, jump pads, ocean platforms and more. Whether you’re a go-it-alone survivalist, a weapon-making warmonger, or a base-building architect, this expansion has a crafting project suited for you.WILL YOU PASS THE TEST?ARK: Genesis takes your story in an all-new direction — and your skill determines your success. Everything is turned up to the highest setting: the challenges, the dangers...and the vast rewards. Only the toughest and smartest survivors will pass all of the simulation’s many tests. Will you be one of them?',\n",

Deadside gets you into realistic game environment full of hopelessness and despair. It tries to keep balance between the dynamics of the shooter and the hardcoreness of “survival” gameplay. The world of the game does not imply the existence of fantastic elements like zombies or anomalies, concentrating the player's attention on realistic aspects of life on the ruins of the dead civilization.DEADSIDE WORLDThe world of Deadside is vast open spaces full of bushy forests and abandoned settlements. Players will have an area of \\u200b\\u200babout 225 sq.km., entangled by a network of roads and rivers (in early access the territory of the game world will be limited to an area of 25 sq.km.)In addition to players, the game world is inhabited by various hostile and friendly NPCs. Going through the forest, you can face a gang of cannibals just about to eat lunch. Or a group of wanderers trying to survive in a hostile environment. The results of these meetings are completely dependent on your decisions and ability to get those decisions to life. Or death.MISSIONSIt's a big world and in order to avoid getting lost and to keep themselves busy, players can use the map to see where in the world armed bandits are raiding, areas being cleared by security forces remains loyal to the ex-government or cannibals settling in abandoned villages. Anyone can take part in mass combat. It will not be an event with a limited number of players, anyone who wishes can go to the mission sector and affect the outcome of the battle. Battles with participation of NPC and players can continue for hours but the reward will go to the one who can seize the prize loot after the mission is completed.WEAPONSThe main features of our combat system are realistic ballistics and hardcore weapon damage.To protect their interests or piss off the other players, about 19 types of firearms and additional equipment (sights, flashlights, etc.) will be available (at the time of early access). TRADE and “SAFE ZONES”Among endless vast wastelands a wanderer will find places where they can buy bullets, food and chit-chat to the damned victims about life, the universe and everything. Maybe swap a story or two about hunting cannibals. Also, there are private lockers for players in Green Zones where they can keep a limited number of things they use for surviving. Green Zones will be places of trade and communication between players and friendly NPC traders.BASE BUILDINGSimple yet effective craft system will let players to build bases and use them as shelters and to store hard-earned weapon and equipment. At the Early Access stages bases will be invulnerable, but later we're planning to implement a raiding system. Players also will have the ability to craft small stashes and hide them almost anywhere in the world to keep a few handy things at the ready.\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"STORYYou just signed on with PAH Inc. Paranormal Activity Helpers Incorporated, yeah sounds corny, but the pay is great. They said you won't ever be in any real danger, and they have tons of work right now. Your first job is at some old haunted house. There is a broker wanting to put the house for sale, but with everyone in the town spreading rumors of evil living inside the house, he needs some proof that it is safe. He actually seems creeped out himself. Anyway, he hired PAH Inc. to check the place out. You can go check it out alone if you'd like, but I would take at least 3 more friends with me. Check the place out, and if there is anything supernatural going on, try to bring evidence back to PAH Inc.MYSTERY OF THE HOUSEThis house was built over 100 years ago. The owners ran a funeral parlor. They held normal funeral services such as ceremonies, wakes, cremation and burying the dead. The rumor around town is that they also offered a very special service, a way to talk to your deceased loved one on last time. Several people paid for the service, and after some type of ritual, they were able to speak to the dead. Something apparently went wrong during one of the rituals. A person from town and the owners of the house disappeared and were never seen again. Over the last century, a few people that investigated the incident never returned. A few kids sneaking around the place claimed to hear laughter and see a little girl in the window. There probably isn't any truth to any of it.GAMEPLAYIn Pacify, you will be running for your life around the narrow corridors of a dark, old house. There is a little girl that switches between good and evil roaming around. Different circumstances can cause her to change. Once the evil takes over, it will chase you and your friends all over the house. You must find a way to Pacify the evil and escape the house. As the game progresses, the evil gets smarter and faster.Play alone in single player mode, or play with up to 3 more friends in multiplayer. In multiplayer mode, you can choose to play with or against your friends. Read the notes for clues about Pacifying the girl. Find and use keys, dolls, wood and matches to help you on your way. The girl can hear and see you. Stay out of sight, and stay as quiet as possible. Try different types of strategies to win.Single Player ModeYou can go in the house alone, but the game will be difficult. You must do the work of 2-4 people all by yourself. It is possible though and very scary to take on the girl all alone! Co-Op ModeIn co-op multiplayer, you work together trying to help each other escape the house. You can save each other from the girl by interrupting her when she catches someone. PVP ModeIn pvp mode, everyone is an intern for PAH Inc. vying to get a full time position. The person that does the most work gets hired. You can push each other down and get in each other's way. Pushing a player on the floor stuns them for 5 seconds and causes them to drop their keys.\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': 'Rising Storm 2: Vietnam is the next in the series that has twice been PC Gamer’s ‘Multiplayer Game of the Year’, bringing the franchise into the era of automatic rifles, man-portable grenade launchers and more modern weapons systems. Still with the authentic look and feel and realistic weapon handling that the series is known for.Continuing the Tripwire tradition of providing strong support for games post-launch, Vietnam has already been updated multiple times, providing the player with:64-player battles6 different armies to play, each with their own weapons and abilities:United States Army and Marine CorpsNorth Vietnamese Army (PAVN) and National Liberation Front (Viet Cong)Australian ArmyArmy of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN)Over 50 weapons, covering everything from rifles and pistols to flamethrowers and rocket launchers4 flyable helicopters - Huey, Cobra, Loach and BushrangerAsymmetric warfare - VC traps and tunnels vs. US napalm and choppersMore than 20 maps3 distinct game-modesProximity VOIPAnd hundreds of character customization options.Rising Storm 2: Vietnam offers intense action for up to 64 players in battles between the forces of South Vietnam (the US and their Allies) and those of the North - the regular, main-force units of North Vietnamese Army, plus the guerilla fighters of the National Liberation Front (or Viet Cong).SOUTHERN FORCES - US, Australian and ARVNThe Southern forces have firepower and mobility on their side, with each army having its own unique supporting arms:US Army/Marine Corps - airburst artillery, the Spooky gunship and napalm strikesAustralian Army - Pair of Canberra bombers and heavy artilleryARVN - medium mortar barrage and napalm strikes from older A-1 SkyraidersFor mobility, they have access to full helicopter support:UH-1 “Huey”: provides rapid transport for a squad across the mapOH-6 “Loach”: acts as both a spotter and airborne command post, as well as a fast gunship, with its minigunsAH-1G “Cobra”: heavily-armed gunship with massive firepower for a pilot and weapons officerAustralian “Bushranger”: a Huey, with dual M60 machine guns, minigun and rocketsTactically, the Southern squad leaders become important - so long as the squad leader is alive and in a smart location, the rest of his squad can spawn in on his location. So keep your squad leaders alive at critical moments!As for weapons, the Southern forces had a wide range of the best weaponry of Western nations, ranging from older, WWII-era leftovers, through to the latest technology of the time:M1 Garand, M2 Carbine, M3 “grease gun”, BAR and M1919 .30-cal LMGM14 Battle Rifle, M40 and XM21 sniper riflesM60 LMG and M16 automatic rifleFor heavier support - the M79 grenade launcher and M9A1-7 flamethrowerExplosives - M61 frag grenade, M8 smoke, C4 explosives and M18 ClaymoreNORTHERN FORCES - NVA and VCThe Northern forces offer a broader mix, with the People’s Army of Vietnam (PAVN - or NVA) as the regular, disciplined and better-equipped main fighting force, in comparison to the National Liberation Front (NLF) guerrilla fighters, equipped with whatever weaponry was passed down the chain to them from Russia and China - known as the Viet Cong. For supporting weapons each has:PAVN/NVA - heavy artillery, surface-to-air missile defenses and rapid reinforcement from the Ho Chi Minh trailNLF/VC - a mix of ordnances (mortars, rockets, white phosphorous) used in a heavy barrageTo compete with the Southern forces’ mobility, the Northern forces have their own mobility - and stealth:NVA and VC squad leaders can place spawn tunnels widely across the maps, allowing themselves and their squads to spawn much closer to the action - or even behind the linesGiven their “home field advantage”, any NVA or VC crouching or prone in cover can’t be spotted by Southern helicopters or aircraftSA-2 Missiles - the quick way to counter Southern air assets is by calling on surface-to-air missiles, if the commander can time it right“Ho Chi Minh Trail” ability - the NVA/VC commander can activate this ability to accelerate his team’s spawning rate, when times get desperate“Ambush Spawn” ability - the NVA/VC commander can also cause anyone on his team who is waiting, to spawn on his location for potentially devastating ambushes.The weaponry for the Northern forces is wide-ranging - the PAVN well-equipped with modern weapons delivered from Russia and China, while the VC have to work with a wide variety of weapons:AK-47 and Type 56 Assault riflesRussian SKS-45 and US M1 Carbines and Mosin Nagant 91/30 rifleMN 91/30 and SVD sniper riflesPPSh-41 and French MAT-49 SMGsIZh-58 double-barrelled shotgunDP-28 and RPD LMGsRPG-7 rocket launcherMD-82 toe-popper mines, Tripwires and Punji traps',\n",

Visit the jungles around Southern China and with it, the fearsome tribes of the Nanman. Will you unite the tribes of the south?As well as expanding the Three Kingdoms map, The Furious Wild includes the new Nanman culture, adding diversity to the base game factions, units and playstyles:4 new playable factions each with their own unique mechanics, with 19 new factions overall populating southern China25+ new units including exciting and formidable animal unitsNew ferocious character artwork New Nanman-specific tech tree with keystone technologies requiring missions to be completedA completely new character progression style, with feats used to unlock traits Unique missions and narrative events bespoke for the Nanman cultureOne goal to ‘Unite the Tribes’, but how will you achieve it, through diplomacy or conquest?Playable in 190 and 194 start datesDifference unites as much as it divides In the verdant jungles of Southern China, forces so far unmet are stirring. The disparate tribes of the Nanman have for centuries lain divided, but now a new leader must emerge to unite them – by any means necessary.  The mighty warriors Meng Huo, King Mulu, Lady Zhurong and King Shamoke bring with them unique methods of battle, from flaming maces and blowpipes, to revered elephants and tigers. Separated they are vulnerable, together, they might just be unstoppable. Play as any of the new playable Nanman factions in the years before their encounter with Zhuge Liang and his famous Southern Campaign. Experience the might of the Southern tribes, all while exploring new areas of the Three Kingdoms map. Can you unify these unique warriors and take on the mighty Han, or will jungle warfare take its toll on these newly formed allegiances?Meng HuoHaving risen through the ranks of the Nanman tribes, Meng Huo has gained repute for his fierce but stubborn leadership. Loyal to his friends but merciless when it comes to his enemies, his tenacity garners him as much trouble as it does success. With one goal in mind – becoming the king of the Nanman – Meng Huo must look to his neighbours to help spread the flames of his rule.King of KingsWhen Meng Huo takes control over another Nanman faction, either by making an alliance or destroying them, he gains certain temporary bonuses. These bonuses can also be stacked, creating a rolling momentum that will surely bring Meng Huo the kingship he desires. Unique Units: Nanzhong Champions: A cut above your usual shield-wielding infantry – perfect for holding your frontline steady as a rock in the face of incoming missilesNanzhong Elephants: Drummers sit atop these mighty elephant units, playing rhythms that provide passive buffs to your nearby units. Use them to wreak havoc on the frontline or pull them back to provide support for your unitsNanzhong Spearmen: The eye-catching rattan armour these spearmen wear provides defense against any errant darts headed their way, leaving them free to focus on any incoming mounted foes Lady ZhurongA descendent of the god of fire, sparks fly when Lady Zhurong enters the battlefield. With a hot temper and an iron will, she seeks to expand her lands, and remove any obstacles in her way. Her passion seems impossible to rival, but there may just be allies closer than she thinks. Goddess of FireAcross the seasons, Lady Zhurong accumulates points toward her Goddess of Fire mechanic. Once enough points have been gathered, players have the ability to activate her Wild Fire bonus; this formidable bonus makes her units near unbeatable in battle. The bonus changes according to the season it is activated within, and these powerful effects last across a series of turns. Once Wild Fire has burned out, Lady Zhurong is vulnerable for a short period and will need to recover before she can fight again without weakness, so time your expansion wisely. Unique Units: Tiger Warriors: These axe-wielding warriors have an ace up their sleeve – their tiger companions. Use these tigers to give your opponents a scare before going in for the killFollowers of the Flame: What’s better than a two-handed mace? A two-handed mace that’s on fire. Engage this fiery unit in as many frontline battles as possible and watch as their damage-over-time effect causes chaos Tiger Slingers: While tigers disrupt your opponent’s line, these slingers will pick off any stragglers who manage to escapeKing MuluIn the undergrowth of the Southern jungle roams King Mulu, a friend to the animal kingdom, but a stranger to man. Spending time in the animal world has gained him many advantages, not least, the mighty elephants that walk by his side. Now Mulu must face his brethren, but will his pride get in the way of future partnerships?Pride & RitualYou know what they say, ‘Pride always comes before a Ritual’, quite literally in the case of Mulu. During his campaign he will accumulate Pride, his faction’s pooled resource, according to the rank of characters he defeats in battle. Your faction will gain lucrative bonuses to animal units, such as an increase in unit capacity and even a decrease in recruitment cost, in line with the amount of Pride you have reached. Periodically, Mulu will take part in spiritual rituals, invoking the elements to grant additional distinct bonuses for his faction.Unique Units: Southern Elephants: A small band of elephants that pack a mighty punch to frontlines, accompanied by some handy slingers on their backs War Elephants: A more heavily armored elephant unit used best to charge into enemies, also accompanied by slingers Ravine Warriors: These frontline warriors are ready to clean up after any elephant-related carnage with a weapon in each handKing ShamokeShamoke’s origins may be as murky as the dense jungle he controls, but his drive for power is all Nanman. As the ruler of the five valleys, several tribes have pledged their allegiance to him, but many remain wary of the leader. The Han’s interest in him has only deepened this suspicion. With both sides in opposition, Shamoke must choose where his loyalty truly lies, and neither choice is without cost.Unification MandateShamoke’s chief concern is uniting the Nanman under his rule, and so, his faction mechanic gives him bonuses according to what unification technique the player chooses to employ. Whether you conquer, subjugate or reform, power is yours for the taking and you will be rewarded for the followers you bring to your side.Unique Units: Might of the Valley: Fast two-handed axe infantry that gain large bonuses when fighting near death – watch as they flank and charge enemies into submissionWuling Slingers: These light-footed short-range units are able to side-step potential terrain penalties – ideal for skirmishing in dense jungle where they can quickly evade and wear down enemy unitsWuling Fighters: Offensive-minded warriors with a health pool hardy enough to take the mightiest of blows. These fighters do best pitted against the strongest heroes',\n",

Purchasing the add-on will unlock its new Killer, new Survivor, and an exclusive item for the survivor:  Felix's The World Class jacket.The Blight, a bright and ambitious chemist who sought to enhance humanity through the use of his compounds, only to become a victim of his ambitions, is the new Killer. After his research was stolen, The Blight was lured into the Realm of the Entity by the promise of new, forbidden knowledge. The new survivor is Felix Richter, an eccentric architect with a unique vision. Returning to the mysterious island where his father had disappeared, Felix descended into the darkness beyond and was never seen again.   The BlightA bright and ambitious chemist from Scotland, Talbot Grimes sought to enhance humanity through the use of his compounds. During his time at the British East India Company, he created a drug that increased workers’ productivity while reducing their need for rest. Despite the rewards he reaped, the drug had fatal side effects, putting workers’ lives in jeopardy for profit. He amassed enemies, and one such man had him abducted, bound, beaten, and left for dead. Barely clinging to life, Talbot was rescued and nursed back to health by the disciples of an ancient mystery school. There, monks studied forbidden texts, striving to expand the human mind in the search for other dimensions. In return for saving Talbot, they asked for his help, believing his knowledge could lead them to their goal. Yet, when he nearly reached his breakthrough, they had him drugged and dumped into an opium den. Frantic to remember his research, a whisper reached out from the corner of his mind to help. He grabbed a stone and etched into the wall. When there was nowhere left to write, he carved the message into his chest. Stained with blood, he witnessed a miracle appear before him—a field of lush, orange flowers. The whispered voice urged him to enter the field and discover dimensions beyond human comprehension. As the orange flowers wilted around him, he descended further into darkness.The Blight’s Power: Blighted CorruptionPustula serum courses through his veins, corrupting his mind and body, yet granting him unnatural physical abilities.  SPECIAL ABILITY: RUSHPress the Power button to quickly Rush forward. Doing so consumes a Rush token. While performing Rush, The Blight cannot launch an attack. Rush into a wall or obstacle in the environment to Slam onto it. If the Rush fails to connect with a wall or obstacle, or if the Blight is out of Rush tokens, he will enter a short fatigue state and begin recharging the tokens.SPECIAL ATTACK: LETHAL RUSHFollowing a Slam, press the Power button to launch a Lethal Rush. Doing so consumes a Rush token. A Lethal Rush behaves the same as a Rush, except The Blight may launch an attack by pressing the Attack button.The Blight comes with 3 new perks.Dragon’s GripAfter damaging a generator, any Survivor that interacts with it will scream, revealing their location for a moment, and will be afflicted with the Exposed status effect for a brief duration.Hex: UndyingWhen Hex: Undying is active and a different hex totem is cleansed, that hex will be transferred to a dull totem—so long as one exists. Survivors auras are revealed for a moment when within short range of any totem.Hex: Blood FavorWhen a Survivor is hit, nearby pallets are held in place by The Entity for a moment. These pallets cannot be pulled down.   Felix Richter Creative, enterprising, and analytical, Felix Richter is an eccentric architect with a unique vision who won several designs awards, including but not limited to the Swiss Architect Medal and the German National Design Award. Turning away from a legacy of medicine, Felix carved his way in the world of design, establishing a name for himself as an architect while establishing the ‘Richter and Golder’ firm with his friend and colleague, Lauren Golder. Despite his success, he was unable to shake the sense that he was a 'hack' and often distracted his anxious mind with booze and parties. When Felix discovered he was going to be a father, he quickly pulled his life together and focused on a project that he believed would prove his worth as an architect. Returning to an island where his father and other members of his father’s secret society disappeared, Felix began extensive plans to restore and reinvent the old, crumbling Victorian buildings.  As he surveyed the ruins of the island, he thought he saw his father beckoning him through a gathering fog below. Without hesitation, Felix descended into the darkness beyond and was never seen again.  Felix comes with 3 new perks.VisionaryIf you are in short range of a generator, you can see its aura.Desperate MeasuresFor each injured, hooked, or dying Survivor, slightly increase the speed at which you heal and unhook your allies.Built to LastOnce per trial, a depleted item will have some of its charges refilled.The Descend Beyond chapter includes an exclusive item: The World Class jacket for Felix, only available as part of the DLC.

Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live.It’s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations:Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost.Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics:Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists.Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations:Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine.Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations:Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly.Always Keep Yourself Breathing:Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis.Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling:Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food. If you’re clever, you might even be able to run a base off colonist farts.Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds:Summon new worlds with a push of a button.

       "  'full_bio': \"About This SoftwareFaceRig is a program enabling anyone with a webcam to digitally embody awesome characters. It is meant to be an open creation platform so everybody can make their own characters, backgrounds or props and import them into FaceRig. (More on http://facerig.com )FaceRig is being developed by Holotech Studios and the image-based face tracking SDK being used is provided by ULSee Inc. To find out more about ULSee Inc., visit http://ulsee.com or email them at info@ulsee.com. Our previous tracking technology was provided by Visage Technologies.FaceRig has three versions:FaceRig Classic is the base version of FaceRig, which allows for home non-profit use and even limited monetization on YouTube/Twitch or similar as long as the commercial aspect of it is not significant. We consider commercially significant using it on any avenue (channel) that produces you more than $500 monthly revenue. This includes ad-based revenue and voluntary donations (one time or recurrent such as a Patreon). If you are under this threshold you can use Classic, if you are above you need to upgrade to Pro or Studio.the FaceRig Pro DLC, which allows you to monetize videos on YouTube/Twitch regardless of the monthly revenue, but not for content exclusive to paid/subscription based services, such as the new YouTube Red (for content that is exclusive to YouTube Red or similar you will need FaceRig Studio).FaceRig Pro does not bring new assets, technical features or improvements to FaceRig Classic.  For more details, take a look at the Pro DLC description the Studio Version allows commercial use, as well as  access to the expression mo-cap data. For more details about this version visit http://facerig.comWe believe that FaceRig will entertain many gamers, modelling and animation artists, members of various fandoms, streamers, web casters, YouTubers and their audiences.For now we're focusing on just tracking and rendering the portrait with its expressions, but we aim to do more in the future. The FaceRig end goal is to provide a full featured real time digital actor set for home use.Key Features:Real time head and expression tracking in an input video stream, (also with audio analysis).Combining tracked data with additional virtual puppeteering input.On-the-fly animation re-targeting for the tracked data and applying the animation on a user selected 3d model, with audio processing (voice alteration) Rendering and lighting the animated model in real time, in a user selected background.Encoding the rendered video and sending it further as output from a virtual webcam (it basically intercepts webcam input, and swaps the images captured by your real webcam with the fantastic content before sending it further).Provide the interface for tuning the parameters of all operations above.Customizable avatars. To see the complete list on FaceRig avatars including the ones from DLC's please see: https://facerig.com/tips/tuesday-tips-0-avatar-list/Open creation platform: you can make your own models (outside of FaceRig), import and use them as your avatars. The models need to be created according to  a set of published specs.Notes:Numeric export of the tracked expression data (exporting the motion capture data to use in other applications) is a feature reserved for the Studio version.FaceRig  Classic and Pro only output already rendered video and audio.FaceRig is an indie initiative, and its development so far has been successfully crowd-funded through Indiegogo. A warm thank you goes to our amazing backers for their support and enthusiasm.You can find the EULA here: http://store.steampowered.com/eula/274920_eula_1\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': 'Free Demo Available HereA free-roaming squad based RPG focusing on open-ended sandbox gameplay features rather than a linear story. Be a trader, a thief, a rebel, a warlord, an adventurer, a farmer, a slave, or just food for the cannibals. Research new equipment and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh desert. Train your men up from puny victims to master warriors. Carry your wounded squad mates to safety and get them all home alive. Features Freeform gameplay in a seamless game world in the largest single-player RPG world since Daggerfall, stretching over 870 square kilometers. The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style. Custom design as many characters as you want and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too. Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre. No \"hero\" characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life. You are not the chosen one. You\\'re not great and powerful. You don\\'t have more \\'hitpoints\\' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it.Build a base where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Variation and possibilities of gameplay. Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself. Dynamic, ever changing world. Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won\\'t stop moving. This is not just a \"game\", you are living and surviving in a simulated world.Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive, or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. Absolutely no Level-scaling. The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don\\'t change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won\\'t hold your hand or help you when you\\'re down. Realistic medical system that affects gameplay. A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A character’s stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. Intelligent AI that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh environment. Independently developed with no design influences, or alterations dictated by men in gray suits who have never played a game before in their lives. Original game world. There are no fantasy-knock-off cliches. No magic.',\n",

Items and Interactions you won’t believe To contribute to those killer stories, Madison’s house is jam-packed with over 50 items to interact with and change the environment around you. Want to change the music of the party? Find the mp3 player! Wanna get shitfaced drunk? Well, hopefully you know what to find. That’s only the beginning--the items you’ll find in House Party get absolutely insane. And sometimes you don’t even need items to cause a ruckus. House Party is an adult game, and your character comes fully “equipped” to make some chaos all on their own.NPCs (Not-Boring Party Comrades)These stories and items, they’d be nothing without the various NPCs who make it all worthwhile. House Party features 15 of the most interesting, reactive, HILARIOUS NPCs you’ll find in any game with the name “House” in the title. These partygoers all have their own motivations and opinions, which makes each of their reactions to your choices different. You’ll be able to form friendships and relationships with these characters as you progress through the night, all of which is tracked by social gauges, just in case you’ve lost track of who’s digging your vibe and who’s only one wrong word away from knocking you the F%^# out. We’re not just talking about the fleshbags either! Sometimes characters are found where you least expect it, like a dude-bro AI or a shit-talking wall-mounted fish! With characters still being added, House Party will contain nearly 20 characters to be found around the party by the time we hit full release. Sex™While nobody on our dev team has had it before, we’ve done tons of research online to find out what human sex looks like. Many of the stories in House Party will lead you into steamy encounters with the various partygoers of the night. With an open-crotch policy to telling these stories, we’ve created sexual encounters that speak to many audiences instead of just the boring traditionalists. Lady love, guy love, you’ll find it all here!',\n",

In battle, Zetterburn uses no weapons except for his razor-sharp claws and ability to control flame. BURN DAMAGE - Zetterburn's special attacks can set opponents on fire, causing them additional damage over time. WILD FIRE - Zetterburn's Down Special places flames on the stage. These flames stay for a period of time, burning any opponents who come in contact with them. FIRE AMP - When an opponent is burning, Zetterburn's Strong Attacks can absorb the flames and launch the burned enemy twice as far, making for an effective killing blow.Orcane is a playful trickster, notorious for escaping even the most precarious of situations. He can transform into water and confuse enemies with a spray of bubbles. PUDDLE TELEPORTATION - Orcane creates a puddle with his Neutral Special or Down Special. He can then teleport to his puddle using his Up Special as a powerful vertical blow or an effective recovery when launched off the stage. BUBBLE EVAPORATION - Orcane can turn his puddle into a pillar of bubbles with his Down Special to trap enemies above the puddle. WATER AMP - When standing on top of his puddle, Orcane can consume the water underneath him to perform powerful Strong Attacks with far greater range and knockback.The youngest trainee in the history of the Air Academy, Wrastor has never lived by anyone's rules but his own. Currently an Aerial Ace for the Air Armada, Wrastor is wrecking havoc among the Armada's enemies and generals alike. WINGED FLIGHT - Wrastor can jump 4 times, making him incredible at controlling the air and recovering from the toughest falls even when things look grim. WIND CURRENT - Wrastor can create a Wind Current with his Forward Special, allowing him to move faster within it and chase his targets more effectively. AERIAL ACE - Wrastor performs his charged Strong Attacks in the air instead of on the ground, a first for this genre.Kragg is a defender of the colossal Aetherian Forest. Deliberate and loyal, he is one of the infamous Wall Runners who patrol the Rock Wall. Unlike other Wall Runners, Kragg has the legendary ability to control the earth with his will. ROCK HURL - Kragg can pull a rock out of the ground and hurl it at opponents. After it leaves his hands, the rock becomes a solid piece of stage that either Kragg or other players can break. DEFENSE BALL - Kragg can curl into a ball and roll toward enemies. Although he can be damaged while in ball form, he cannot be knocked away. EARTH PILLAR - Kragg can summon a pillar of earth to his feet regardless of where he is. If Kragg is about to fall to his death, this move can quickly turn his situation around.Forsburn is the disgraced, eldest son of the Firelands' ruling family. After being condemned by the Fire Council and his own brother, Forsburn found refuge in a group of outsiders who had rejected the flame and mastered the way of smoke. SMOKE SCREEN - Forsburn can use his Neutral Special to obscure the battlefield allowing Forsburn to remain hidden inside a cloud of smoke. DECOY - Through his Forward Special, Forsburn can create a smoke facsimile of himself that can attack opponents. The illusory Forsburn breaks into smoke after being hit by a single attack. CONSUME/COMBUST - By using his Down Special, Forsburn can consume his smoke clouds back into his body. After consuming three clouds, Forsburn is charged up and can use Down Special again to combust: knocking opponents away at high speed.Maypul is the self-appointed Guardian of the Aetherian Forest. She commands fearful respect throughout the forest for her unhesitating vigilantism. She uses her agility to trap any unknown intruders before they even realize she is there. WATCHER'S MARK - Maypul can use her Seeds or her Watcher's Dash to mark opponents, making them susceptible to her following attacks. WRAPPED UP - After marking her targets, Maypul can use her Strong Attacks or her trusty Plant to wrap marked opponents in place allowing her to follow up with another attack. SLING SHOT - Maypul can use her vines to sling toward marked opponents, allowing her to elude attacks and quickly close distances.Absa is a famed engineer and martialist of the Elders of the Air Alliance. Despite the laws of the Elders, Absa secretly developed storm techniques in the caves of the Archai mountains. CLOUD CONTROL - Absa can place a cloud using her Neutral or Forward Special. This cloud hangs in the air until Absa bursts it by tapping her Neutral Special and knocking enemies away. THUNDER BOLT - Absa can charge her Neutral Special to create a powerful lightning blast that connects her to her cloud. All opponents caught between the two will be knocked away at high speeds. CONDENSED STORM - Absa focuses the power of a lightning bolt to the tip of her hoof. If she can line up one of her aerial kicks perfectly, she unleashes great power.Etalus is a legendary warrior in his native land. He is one of the last surviving members of the Harbor Guard and uses the power of ice to augment his massive strength. HOME ICE ADVANTAGE: Etalus can use his Forward Special or Forward Tilt to freeze the ground beneath him in order to slide across on the icy surface. ARMORED UP: When standing on ice, Etalus can use his Neutral Special to absorb the ice and create ice armor around his body. AVALANCHE: Etalus can use his Down Special to shatter all nearby ice, instantly freezing any enemies who are standing on it.Ranno was known as be a feared martial artist who trained under wise monks. But now he prefers to peacefully protect his swampy homeland. When he has no other option, you can see glimpses of his rapid and deliberate strikes.POISON STACKS - Ranno’s Specials Strong Attacks and Jab Combo apply up to four poisonous stacks on his opponents. These stacks damage opponents when they attack and can be removed by hitting Ranno.TOXIC TRAP - Ranno’s Neutral Special and Down Special can place his opponents in a Toxic Bubble Trap that makes it easier for Ranno to combo. The length of time in the trap depends on the number of Poison Stacks on the opponent.POISON SPIN - Ranno’s recovery onto stage has three options. He begins it with a Poison Lunge that is quick and knocks opponents away. After the lunge he can quickly Poison Kick down onto the stage with another quick strike. Or he can use the Posion Spin to fire out an array of Posion Darts in many directions. Clairen is a seasoned warrior from a distant future where the heroes of flame vanish and never return. After being defeated by a tyrannical and ever-living emperor, she travels back in time in order to defeat him.IONIZED TIP - Unlike the other soldiers from the future, Clairen manipulates her blade to be two-toned. The end of Clairen's sword is super-charged, allowing her to stun enemies who are hit precisely with the tip. PLASMA ECHO - Clairen dashes forward with her Side Special to quickly escape. The deadly plasma resonance left behind can damage enemies and even KO opponents with its sweet spot.ENERGY FIELD - Performing a Down Special right before an attack hits Clairen will trigger her energy field. This field damages and pushes other Rivals away while nullifying all projectiles that try to enter it.Sylvanos is the heart of the Aetherian Forest. A rageful deity, Sylvanos has only a single goal - to expand the forest over all of Aether. Unfortunately, the great Rock Wall traps the spirit as he patrols the forest’s floor. Sylvanos leads the plant life in the forest looking for ways to expand his dominance.UNTAMED GROWTH - Sylvanos spreads grass as he runs around. The grass leaves if Sylvanos is away from it for too long. Sylvanos can use Down Special to call Plants Rise and damage any opponents standing on grass.SEED SHOT - Sylvanos’ Neutral Special fires a deadly seed into the air. If it hits an opponent it will lock them in place, but if it reaches the ground then it will plant a flower that maintains a permanent fixture of grass on that ground or platform until it is destroyed.BURROW - Sylvanos can dig into solid ground and reappear by digging out from a different position. If he digs under grass he can pop out with a strong bite attack to KO enemies off the top of the screen.Elliana is a snake from the burrows in the Eastern Wastelands who has always dreamt of flying. After her dreams of joining the Air Armada were crushed by an intolerant captain, she sought the aid of Ayala, a brilliant engineer. Together they built a steam-powered flying machine and with it, Elliana now plans to destroy the armada that rejected her.OVERHEAT - Elliana’s ship heats up when she uses specials or her unique double jump that allows her to hover. Once overheated she can no longer use her specials or hover, becoming more vulnerable to her enemies.LETTING OFF STEAM - Elliana can perform Strong Attacks to expel steam away from her ship, lowering her Overheat bar. The steam can also catch opponents or be blown away by attacks. When she is overheated, her strong attacks let off a powerful explosion instead that can KO opponents.ABANDON SHIP - Elliana can use her Up Special to abandon ship even when overheated. She launches herself high into the air and her ship explodes. Be careful, as she is very vulnerable while outside of her ship and she must rebuild it upon landing on the ground.Ori and Sein are from the hit indie game Ori and the Blind Forest and they bring their skills to the test in Rivals of Aether. While Ori works to Bash, Stomp and Glide his way to victory, Sein can use the Spirit Flame or the Charged Flame to put enemies between a rock and a hard place.SPIRIT FLAME – Sein follows Ori around the battlefield. Ori can tap Neutral Special to have Sein quickly fire a Spirit Flame from wherever Sein is. Ori can hold Neutral Special to have Sein use the Charged Flame.BASH – Ori can use Down Special to Bash nearly anything in Rivals of Aether – from characters to projectiles to rocks and plants. Ori can also move around the stage by bashing the Light Grenade that is thrown by using Forward Special.TAG TEAM – When Ori and Sein are close enough, Ori can use Strong Attacks to initiate tag team combos. These Strong Attacks have more powerful properties as Sein assists Ori for a more devastating blow.Shovel Knight has learned a lot during Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove and he brings those skills with him to Rivals of Aether. Shovel Knight swings, digs and shovel drops his way through the Rivals roster. He does it all while collecting treasure which he can use to purchase upgrades to give him the upper hand on the battlefield.TREASURE HUNTER – Shovel Knight’s attacks knock coins and gems out of his opponents. He can collect these to increase his treasure. By taunting, he summons Chester and can use his treasure to purchase either Relics or Armors to improve his fighting ability.SHOVEL DROP – Shovel Knight’s signature ability is his Down Air in Rivals of Aether. With this attack he can strike his opponents from above and bounce off their heads. Hold the attack button to keep the Shovel beneath him. He can also bounce off objects and projectiles!EXPERT FISHERMAN – Shovel Knight’s down special is the Fishing Rod. Use it off the side of the stage to fish up some treasure. Time it correctly and fish up a Treasure Rock, but time it perfectly and get a Golden Fish. \",\n",

       "  'full_bio': 'The Isle: A World Designed to Kill YouThe Isle is intended to be a gritty, open-world survival horror game. Explore vast landscapes of dense forest and open plains, traverse treacherous mountains and wade through dark swamps where horrors lurk. Hidden within are ruins that hold insight as to what came before. Through it all, keep in mind there is only one goal: survive. There is little in the way of hand holding or ulterior precepts to alter play styles or purpose. It\\'s kill or be killed. In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself. Over the course of development the islands and their inhabitants will radically change, ever-evolving as players themselves learn how to flourish and thrive. Your mistakes will be punished. Expect no survivors.Massive Prehistoric MultiplayerBecome the beast within. When joining The Isle, you can play as one of dozens of unique creatures, from tiny darting herbivores like Dryosaurus to blood-thirsty giants such as T. Rex or Allosaurus (with many more still to come!) As a dinosaur, you\\'ll be the epitome of majestic, cunning and ferocious. Use your natural abilities and senses to stay off the menu and grow into a stronger, more capable creature.Engage with a living prehistoric ecosystem as you become either predator or prey on servers featuring up to 100+ players, all of them as hungry and dangerous as you. Form packs/herds, create nests, defend your offspring, hunt, and claim territory. A single mistake can spell your demise.Survival or Sandbox?The Isle\\'s core game mode is Survival, a tense and difficult experience where you need to grow fast or die young. Dinosaurs in Survival mode progress through several life stages, starting out small and vulnerable. Use your scent ability, night vision and wits to survive long enough to grow, becoming more powerful and unlock new abilities such as nesting. Because of the time needed to develop a full character life cycle, not every creature is or will be playable in Survival, though more will be added in future updates. However, sometimes you don\\'t want to struggle to survive, or you don\\'t have the time to go through a dinosaur\\'s whole life story. And that\\'s okay. For players who want a less intense experience, Sandbox mode lets you play an expanded roster of dinosaurs (and soon humans!). You can jump right in as an adult super predator or a peaceful giant, with no major penalties or consequences from dying. We won\\'t judge.A Global Community StoryThe Isle features a narrative told strictly through the environment, achievable only through immense cooperation among players. Are you stranded? Can you just leave? What is AE? How did the dinosaurs get here? What is the distant call that pierces the night? It will take the entire community to answer these mysteries and unravel the purpose to their being on The Isle, and each discovery will directly affect the future of the game\\'s storyline.Future Development GoalsWe realize that there is a long road ahead, and a lot of work to be done to turn this into the game we want it to be. Throughout development, we will be adding a lot more to The Isle and incorporating user feedback in how we evolve the experience. Some of our planned features include:Playable aquatic and aerial creaturesEven more playable dinosaurs with complete life cyclesTwo new playable factions: modern humans & the indigenousEvolve into advanced \"strain\" versions of certain dinosaursRealistic dinosaur AI that uses complex behavioursAdditional world biome types such as thick junglesDynamic aerial drop-in spawn systemGlobal in-game world questLocalization of all in-game menus & textBetter accessibility & customization optionsSteam Achievements, Trading Cards, EmotesMod support using Steam WorkshopAll that and more are on our radar going forward. We started with a plan of just a mere handful of playable carnivores, but based on player demand we expanded our scope, increased that number greatly and introduced herbivorous dinosaurs as well. Listening to our community has been instrumental in guiding our process and helped to correct our mistakes, and we hope that together we can transform The Isle into the ultimate dinosaur game. --AE Core TX Received----End Promotional Protocol----SiGnaL InTeRrUpt---tHEeNdISnevErTheENDisNeVeRtHeEnDIsNev-',\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"Enter the world of Eco, a fully simulated ecosystem bustling with thousands of growing plants and animals living their lives. Build, harvest, and take resources from an environment where your every action affects the world around you. An imminent meteor strike threatens global destruction.  Can you save the world without destroying it in the process?Construct buildings and towns, tend to your farm, hunt wildlife, build infrastructure and transportation, craft clothing, build power plants, and research new technologies. Specialize in a craft and trade your goods to other players. Develop your civilization and sculpt your planet.As your civilization grows, you’ll need to analyze data from the simulation; evaluating the impact you have on your world.  Use this data as evidence in proposed laws, restricting harmful activities without disrupting the advancement of technology. Balance your individual needs with the needs of community, all while maintaining the state of the ecosystem. The future of your world is in your hands.Every organism in Eco exists as part of a detailed simulation; a disruption in one species can have cascading effects across the planet. Chop down all the trees, and habitats for creatures will be destroyed. Pollute the rivers with mining waste, and your farms will become poisoned and die. The ecosystem supplies the resources you and your community will need to stop the meteor.  Manage your pollution, mining waste, hunting, and resource collection to balance your effect on this system.  Eco is built on a rich ecological simulation. All the data generated from the interaction of plants, animals, climate, and players can be searched and analyzed using in-game graphs and heat-maps. Use the collected information as scientific evidence support to proposed laws.  The ability to successfully debate using scientific evidence is your greatest weapon against the destruction of your world.Establish and maintain your own set of laws and government, which are enforced automatically by the game. Draft a proposal to limit clear-cutting in a protected forest, incentivize green energy solutions over fossil fuels by providing tax subsidies and penalties. Participate in elections for world leadership, allowing you to set tax rates and allocate community money.  Use a programmable law system to make dynamic and flexible rules for the community, passing them by vote.   Construct a wide variety of governments; from tightly-regulated dictator-states, to tax-and-spend subsidy programs, or even lawless communities relying on trust.Your skills increase based on your food and shelter. By consuming a highly nutritious variety of food and building an elaborate home you will rapidly increase your skill points. Skill points can be spent on skills like farming, hunting, trade, engineering, research, and more. Contribute to the greater good while increasing your own personal success.In the player-run economy, you achieve the most when you specialize and trade both goods and services. Create stores to buy and sell goods you need asynchronously with other players. Setup contracts within the game’s quest-like labor market, soliciting other players to perform specialized work for you in exchange for payment. Build complex crafting machines and charge a fee for players to use them. A thriving economy in Eco can be both a powerful tool for progress, or a dangerous threat to the environment.To grease the wheels of commerce, you can create your own currencies, backed by fiat or by resources.  Manage the value of your currency relative to others by setting exchange rates at asynchronous currency exchanges. Sell items at stores and collect credit from other players.  Eco is designed for rich asynchronous play, allowing many players of many disciplines to contribute to one another’s goals at separate or simultaneous times. All of the world’s resources originate from its environment, which is affected by your actions.  While a meteor looms over head —  set to strike the planet in thirty days — a more subtle threat grows from player-interaction with the environment.  Without careful attention, ecological destruction can destroy civilization before the meteor even strikes.  To ultimately succeed, you and your community will need to use the tools of government and economy to find a balance between progress and protection.Included FeaturesOnline Multiplayer - Collaborate online with a community of players.Local Singleplayer - Build your own world, with the option to invite friends.Dedicated Server Included - Host your own Eco worlds.Over 30 different craft tables, with hundreds of recipes.Hundreds of items, skills, craft tables, and building blocks.A simulated ecosystem with dozens of unique species.With limited carrying capacity, players must create vehicles and networks of roads to transport materials.Create your own backed or fiat currencies, using them as a means of exchange in the economy.Build stores where you can sell your excess items for a profit.Eat varied and nutritious food and build ever larger homes to increase your skills.Create contracts for jobs that you would like players with different skill-specialties to accomplish for you.  Take on contracts from other players that need the skills you possess.  Design laws using programmable template system to protect your world or increase your profits, enforced by the game if ratified by the population.Run for election and make decisions that affect the globe.View and compile rich data from the simulation and use it to argue for group decisions.Claim land as your own property, and share access rights.Give and remove reputation from other players.Find a balance between progress and protection, between individual needs and those of the group, succeeding or failing together.Eco is our forever project. We plan to keep growing, expanding, and improving it with the support of the community. Follow our plans and progress through the Eco Tree, which displays in-depth details on current and future features. The Eco Tree can be found on Eco's official website.\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"Fantasy Grounds is an application acting as a virtual online gaming table primarily intended for pen and paper style narrative role playing games.  It is designed to perform many of the things you can do while playing at a conventional gaming table and move it online.Shop DLC in the updated Steam StoreYou can browse by category more easily from the SmiteWorks Publish Page link below.BROWSE DLC.A Note about DLC for Fantasy GroundsFantasy Grounds has a wealth of DLC available as add-ons. Each of these DLC add-ons expands Fantasy Grounds to support a brand new game system or to add new adventures and supplements from your favorite game publishers and artists. SmiteWorks has negotiated license deals with several dozen different RPG Game publishers and artists, both large and small, to bring you a very large variety of gaming options. Our agreements with these publishers and artists provide royalties for every purchase made through Steam and elsewhere, so that a purchase of DLC for Fantasy Grounds is the equivalent to or better for the publisher than walking into a game store or book store and buying a physical book from the publisher. Each and every purchase is directly helping fund and grow the RPG hobby industry. The share that SmiteWorks retains for this helps pay our content and programming developers and helps us add support for more and more games. In many cases, the content you can buy as DLC can be built directly by you within Fantasy Grounds if you already own the material in another form. The DLC provides a convenient option for time-strapped gamers who also wish to directly support the gaming industry.* This is not a stand-alone game. This game features no computer controlled AI and relies upon another user acting as a Gamemaster to control the story, action and enemies you face.OverviewFantasy Grounds is a hybrid application which allows you to play and create your own RPG games. It facilitates this play and provides some optional add-on Adventure modules which can be loaded and played with very little preparation. Each game will require a GameMaster (GM) and one or more players. Games may be played in a session as short as a few hours or continued with multiple sessions over a series of days, weeks, months or years. A GM will typically install the application and choose their game-system of choice, which we refer to as a Ruleset. Fantasy Grounds comes pre-loaded with Rulesets supporting compatible play for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2E, Dungeons & Dragons 3.5, Dungeons & Dragons 4E, Dungeons & Dragons fifth edition and the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (R). Additional Rulesets are available for free and for purchase from our Workshop. The 3.5E, 5E and PFRPG rulesets are good places to start for new GMs and for people new to Fantasy Grounds. These Rulesets come pre-loaded with some basic Library modules full of abilities, spells, monsters and items that have been marked as Open Gaming Content (OGC) by their respective copyright holders.  The 5E ruleset contains all the content from the D&D Basic Rules for D&D fifth edition. Additional rulesets, such as that for Call of Cthulhu or Savage Worlds are fully licensed versions and contain otherwise closed and proprietary content that we've licensed from those publishers. As of April 2015, Fantasy Grounds acquired an official license from Wizards of the Coast for D&D fifth edition. This means that the 5E ruleset supports basic understanding and gameplay for D&D fifth edition but you can also buy fully preloaded data packs and adventures that are licensed from Wizards of the Coast as DLC here on Steam.PlayersFor players, Fantasy Grounds will allow you to connect to a game being hosted by a GM and control one or more characters within the game. You will be able to update and maintain your character sheet, much like you would in a face-to-face RPG game, but with some degree of automation and support for dragging and dropping abilities and items from the Library modules (for rulesets which support them.) Whenever a GM shares a map image, you will be able to move a token representing your character and initiate attack rolls against enemies visible on those maps when it is your turn. You will be interacting within the GM's game session with other players and every action you take will be communicated to the GM and connected players along with any chat messages you enter into the chat window. At the conclusion of the GM's game session, you will log out and your character sheet and progress will be saved to the GM's session. When you meet back up and a pre-scheduled time with the GM for the next session, you will be able to continue where you left off.  Scheduling of future game sessions is handled outside of Fantasy Grounds via email communication, the Fantasy Grounds forums and Game Calendar, Steam discussions or through whatever source the GM defines.  SmiteWorks hopes to improve the match-making features at a later date.GameMastersFor GameMasters, Fantasy Grounds will allow you to outline and prepare your future game sessions. You will be able to create story entries and link them together or to specific maps. You could, for instance, create a story entry which links to an image of a dungeon and then each room could in turn be linked to individual story entries -- each containing room descriptions, secret GM notes, a list of NPCs and monster encounters or links to more images and player hand-outs. Depending on your game master style and the availability of pre-entered monsters and enemies, you can also run without preparation. You can create and maintain multiple Campaigns, each with their own content and players. When you are ready to run your campaign, you will need to spend some time recruiting players and establishing your preferred frequency and length of play, methods of communication when you are not connected with Fantasy Grounds and whether or not you want to use a voice application such as Skype or Google Hangouts alongside Fantasy Grounds. Most GMs tend to use a combination of in-game text-based chat within Fantasy Grounds *and* a voice application to help facilitate quicker and more natural play.With this version of the product, you can:Run games as the Gamemaster (GM)Host games as a GM for other players and GMs who are connected as playersHost a demo game for 1 player who is using only the FG Demo. The campaign won't allow saving, but will give you the ability to demonstrate the functionality to prospective players.Join games as a playerCreate characters locally to take with you into a game sessionCreate additional rulesets and modifications with custom XML and LUA ScriptingUse hundreds of built-in top-down tokens for monsters, characters and animals\",\n",

Players are sent stalking through the surreal post-apocalyptic Pechorsk Radius Zone where physics-based interaction, realistic weapon handling, and moody atmosphere will get your adrenaline pumping as you struggle to survive in an unforgiving dystopian environment.Open-world exploration, climbing, stealth and a dynamic day/night cycle. This creepy immersive VR survival shooter is inspired by 'Roadside Picnic' (Пикник на обочине).The Pechorsk RadiusIn 1987 the 'Pechorsk Event' changed everything for the quiet Soviet mining town. Locals described the event as a short earthquake, which caused clouds of dust to rise into the sky, reducing visibility to almost nothing. After the dust settled, they stated seeing a huge dark-red orb in the sky, with black ash floating around the area.By 2002, The United Nations Pechorsk Special Committee (UNPSC) still administers the exclusion zone around the Pechorsk Radius, and no one is allowed to enter aside from the UNPSC specialists. Inside, it has been almost completely abandoned and stands as an isolated and blighted territory. Rumors, conspiracies, and legends continue to emerge - alluding to wondrous artifacts, deadly anomalies and bizarre entities that inhabit the once quiet mining region.ExploreThere are miles and miles of forests, swamps and crumbling industrial ruins for you to explore however you want.But be careful: the Radius is filled with strange, lethal anomalies and hostile forces that threaten anyone foolish or daring enough to risk their lives.Orienteer with your realistic map, plan your mission route, climb over obstacles, scout out shelters, uncover loot caches, and try not to get killed. At least not too often.Realistic WeaponsFeaturing classic Soviet firearms like the AKM Kalashnikov, PM Pistolet Makarova, SKS Carbine, and much more to come. Realistic interaction, manual magazine loading with different ammo types and weapon attachments.Be sure to switch off the safety before you start firing! Realistic bullet physics cause ricochets, and bullets can penetrate different kinds of materials. Take care of your weapons – if they take damage or their condition deteriorates, they will begin to jam.SurvivalYour only means of survival is to stalk around with your detector, hunt for artifacts and complete missions assigned to you by the UNPSC.Stealth, silence, and preparation are your best friends in the Radius Zone. Understand how to navigate the terrain, move slowly, take cover, crouch, sneak, and beware of the threats around you!Pack the right gear for your journey and plan ahead. Use the realistic day / night cycle to your advantage - scavenge for loot and scout during the day, sneak around quietly and evade your enemies under the cover of night.\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"A game of woodland might and right.Play the digital adaptation of the beloved tabletop board game. Root is a game of adventure and war where 2 to 4 players battle for control of a vast wilderness.The nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance’s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.Meanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright.The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.The most recent conquerors of the forest, the Marquise de Cat plays a game of engine building and logistics while policing the vast wilderness. By collecting Wood they are able to build Workshops, Sawmills, and Recruiters to help her score victory points. Marquise de Cat has the largest army in ROOT, but numbers alone won’t be enough to secure the forest...The Marquise de Cat builds a mighty industrial war machine to subdue the forest. Each time the Marquise builds a Workshop, Sawmill, or Recruiter, you score victory points. The more of the same building she has on the map, the more points scored. However, to fuel ongoing construction, the Marquise must maintain and protect a strong, interconnected economy of Wood. While it may be tempting to overwhelm your opponents with sheer numbers, this leaves you at great risk of spreading yourself too thin and ultimately not being able to keep up.The Eyrie Dynasties once ruled the wood, before the coming of the Cats. They must retake control by capturing territory and building Roosts before they collapse back into squabbling. The Eyrie are proud and bound to the decrees of their leaders. Each leader brings with them different specialties and advantages. The right leader at the right time could lead you to victory, but the wrong leader could cripple your chances of reclaiming the forest.During the Evening, the Eyrie score victory points based on the number of roosts on the map. The greater their presence in the Woodlands, the greater their gains. However, the Eyrie are bound by their Decree, an ever-increasing set of mandated actions promised by their leader. Each turn, they must take all of the actions on their Decree, or else fall into turmoil.The Woodland Alliance doesn’t take kindly to despots - old or new. Marquise, Eyrie, they’re all the same. Only through the will of the people can this wood be ruled! The Woodland Alliance are masters of guerrilla warfare, they begin slowly but can build into a late-game powerhouse - but only if they can manage to subvert the other would-be rulers along the way.The Woodland Alliance works to gain the sympathy of the various creatures of the forest. Each time the Alliance places a sympathy token, they may score victory points. The more sympathy on the map they have, the more victory points they score. Gaining the sympathy of the people requires supporters. These supporters can also be put toward violent ends, inciting outright rebellion across the forest. When a revolt erupts, the Alliance will establish a base. Bases allow the Alliance to train officers, increasing their military strength and flexibility.The Vagabond is an adventurer to some, a trader to others, and thief to more, and an all-around scoundrel. As the Vagabond, you will explore all over the map, beyond just it's clearings, into dense woods to find items and ruins. You can trade and lend aid to the warring factions of the forest to help you complete your own secret quests.The Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict while going on quests to increase his renown throughout the wood. Each time the Vagabond improves their relationship with another faction, or removes a warrior belonging to a faction hostile toward them, the Vagabond scores victory points. You can also complete quests to score victory points. To move and act effectively the Vagabond must manage a pack of items, expand your selection by exploring the forest ruins and providing aid to other factions.\",\n",

Enrol as the commander and order gun runs or artillery to support your team, play as one of the many infantry roles, join a logistics section and fortify the battlefield with fortifications and emplacements and resupply the frontline or be one of the armoured crew members and crew a tank. Communicate with our in-game VoIP with your squad or use the local proximity fade to talk to players nearby to help the flow of battle._Armored CombatArmoured vehicles played a tremendous role in WW2 and were feared due to their destructive nature. Join a tank section with 3 other players and crew multiple accurately modelled steel beasts as the driver, gunner or commander. Every vehicle features realistic values such as turret speed, armour thickness and type of rounds. Calculate the range of an enemy vehicle and shoot at its internal components to disable or destroy them._Tactical, Immersive & AuthenticImmersion is one of the fundamental key elements in Post Scriptum. Experience the authentic reproduction of an incoming Stuka siren or artillery cannons firing from afar. The piercing sound of an incoming heavy round cutting through the air past you. The cracks of bullets and shrapnel. Any kind of caliber, any kind of damage to body and steel, the soundscape and visual fx were thought out to the tiniest detail to make you fully immersed in the battlefield.',\n",

       "  'full_bio': 'About This ContentEnlist for active duty with Arma 3 Apex and be deployed to a brand new warzone. With its distinct geographical features, the South Pacific island archipelago of Tanoa introduces fresh opportunities for all types of combat operations. Engage in Arma 3’s tactical gameplay, where movement, shooting, and teamwork truly matter, and make use of new vehicles, weapons and gear to overcome the challenges of a hostile foreign terrain. The Apex expansion represents the pinnacle of over 15 years of Arma development. Enjoy one of the most meaningful gaming experiences on PC; feel the adrenaline-rush of a hard-earned victory, discover a continuously evolving platform packed with official and player-created content, and join one of thousands Arma community groups to meet new people from across the world. Authentic, open, and diverse – this is the PC’s premier military game at its finest. Welcome to Arma 3 Apex!Key Features In Arma 3 ApexTanoaHome to lush tropical vegetation, unique landmarks, a rich history, and imposing man-made feats of modern engineering, this 100 km² South Pacific archipelago is built to bolster authentic combat on a massive scale. Tanoa’s varied locations, such as the rainforests, volcano, shanty towns, sugar cane factory, and industrial port, cater to all scenario types. Whether it’s to conduct an all-out assault, a small-scale covert op, jungle warfare, or anything else suited to a South Pacific setting – Tanoa is the destination of choice. Your next adventure awaits.New Faction, 13 New Weapons, New Uniforms & GearWhile looking to increase their strategic influence in the South Pacific, NATO and CSAT face resistance from a local criminal organization with deep roots on Tanoa. Consisting of armed thugs and ex-paramilitaries, this new faction, Syndikat, is involved in many illicit operations throughout the region, carrying familiar contemporary firearms like the AKS-74U, AKM, and AK-12 Assault Rifles, LIM-85 Light Machine Gun, RPG-7 Launcher, and the PM 9 mm pistol. NATO and CSAT, on the other hand, send in highly trained operators with state-of-the-art weaponry, such as the modular SPAR-16 Assault Rifle, the Chinese-designed CAR-95 family of weapons, Type 115 Assault Rifle, CMR-76 and SPAR-17 Marksman Rifles, and new thermal-masking uniforms, headgear, backpacks, NVGs (Night Vision Goggles), ERCO weapon optics, and more.10 New VehiclesThe Apex expansion enables more gameplay opportunities by introducing new vehicle classes to Arma 3. Take advantage of the flexibility provided by the V-44 X Blackfish and Y-32 Xi’an VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft, which combine the strengths of fixed- and rotor-wing transportation. Need to move quickly on the ground? Navigate the rugged terrain of Tanoa with the fast and flexible Prowler or Qilin LSVs (Light Strike Vehicles). To complete objectives with minimal losses, Arma 3\\'s arsenal is also reinforced by two new UCAV (Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle) drones: KH-3A Fenghuang and MQ-12 Falcon. Plus, as could be expected in a tropical island setting, Arma 3 Apex includes suitable new civilian vehicles in the form of the MB 4WD Offroad Car, Caesar BTT Propeller Airplane, RHIB (Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat), and Water Scooter.Co-op Campaign & End Game MultiplayerTake on the role of a NATO CTRG special operator in the 1-4 player \"Apex Protocol\" co-op campaign. Connected to the events in the original Arma 3 \"The East Wind\" campaign, your team is sent to Tanoa in order to prevent a humanitarian disaster, but quickly find themselves facing a far bigger threat than they bargained for. The co-op campaign consists of highly replayable missions, featuring a drop-in/drop-out multiplayer structure, and the difficulty scales up or down based on the number of players. In addition to the co-op campaign, Arma 3 Apex adds two brand new End Game multiplayer scenarios on Tanoa, as well as a new singleplayer Showcase End Game scenario to familiarize players with the mode\\'s objectives and rules.\"Old Man\" Singleplayer ScenarioIn this open-world singleplayer scenario, which was released as a free bonus addition in April 2020, you step into the shoes of a retired Legionnaire living on the island of Tanoa. When a new strain of malaria causes yet another humanitarian crisis, and local authorities fail to distribute an effective vaccine to the civilian population, you are tipped off about a possible plot and set out to uncover the truth.Additional Apex ContentThe Apex expansion is complemented by a wide range of additional content. This includes: Gendarmerie faction (Tanoa local law enforcement agency) armed with a new Protector 9 mm Sub-Machine Gun, NATO and CSAT faction reinforcements in the form of special forces and Pacific expeditionary units, a selection of existing Arma 3 weapons and vehicles repainted in a South Pacific camo pattern, new character appearances: Tanoan and Chinese, new radio protocols: French, French-English, and Chinese, new environment assets and props for content creators, a Tanoa Zeus Game Master scenario, 13 new Steam Achievements, and the Arma 3 Apex official soundtrack.Free Platform UpdatesThe Arma 3 Apex expansion is supported by major platform updates, featuring a wide variety of new content, features, and enhancements.

       "  'full_bio': 'In an alternate reality in 1920s Europa, it\\'s been several years since the \"Great War\", but the ashes of the conflict are still hot and the war is entering a new phase. The first conflict saw the emergence of some incredible engines of war known as Mechs. Built by \"The Factory\", an independent city-state which has since become the object of everyone\\'s desire, these technological monstrosities roam the snowy landscapes of Europa. Be the hero of one of the five factions – Saxony Empire, Crimean Khanate, Rusviet Union, Polania Republic or Nordic Kingdom – and become the richest and most powerful nation in all of Europa during these dark times! To assure the victory of your people, you will need to explore and conquer new territories, enlist new recruits and deploy your forces by building formidable and terrifying combat Mechs. Replay history in a fictional past full of mechanical engines and technology, where each choice you make will be critical. Choose your battles with care, because in Scythe, victory is achieved with and for the people! Asymmetry: every player starts the game with different resources (energy, coins, keen combat sense, popularity…), a different starting location and a secret objective. The starting positions are specifically set to contribute to the uniqueness of every faction and the asymmetrical nature of the game. Strategy: Scythe offers players almost complete control over their fate. The only elements of chance apart from each player\\'s individual secrete objective card are the Encounter cards, which players draw to interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Combat is also handled by way of choice; no luck or chance is involved. Engine Building: Players can improve their construction abilities to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits into their faction, activate mechs to dissuade opponents from invading and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. This aspect creates a feeling of energy and progression over the course of the entire game. The order in which players get to develop their economy and technologies adds to the unique feel of every game, even when playing as the same faction several times.',\n",

       "  'full_bio': 'The latest title in the famous Combat Mission franchise of wargames, now on Steam. Shock Force 2 brings you to a hypothetical conflict in Syria between the forces of NATO and the Syrian Army.Take command of US Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) and Heavy Brigade Combat Teams (HBCT) to fight against Syrian Army Infantry, Mechanized and Armored units in an arid setting. Experience the full range of modern threats to conventional military forces, including irregular combat forces, terrorists, spies, suicide bombers, IED\\'s and other deadly tools employed in the asymmetric warfare of the modern day. Play the Task Force Thunder campaign, more than a dozen carefully crafted battles, or unlimited Quick Battles.HOW THE GAME IS PLAYEDPlayers are assigned detailed missions to accomplish based on a richly diverse set of Objectives. Missions can be played in either Real Time or our WeGo hybrid turn based mode introduced with the first Combat Mission game 20 years ago. WeGo allows each player to plan out 60 seconds of combat and then watch as both sides\\' commands are carried out simultaneously. The WeGo system also allows for re-watching turn action and playing against another player by email (PBEM) or \"hotseat\" on a single computer. RealTime and WeGo head to head play can also use TCP/IP on a LAN or over the Internet. Massive replayability comes from a unique Quick Battle system which allows players to purchase their own custom force and fight over the battlefield of their choice from a wide array of different maps. A powerful map and scenario Editor allows you to create battles or campaigns for yourself and others.HOW UNITS ARE PORTRAYEDAll units are portrayed one for one in 1:1 scale in high resolution polygon 3D models with articulated suspensions, animated hatches, and other features that make them feel real. Unlike other 3D tactical wargames, Combat Mission combines real world physics with a thoroughly researched portrayal of forces, right down to what the individual soldiers cary into battle. Advanced vehicle damage modeling allows for tracking of each sub-system, including the most realistic ballistics, armor and post-armor effects available in any game. Unlike other games that claim this level of realism, Combat Mission actually delivers it across the whole spectrum of warfare, including the interaction of weather, lighting, and terrain on how units and their weapons function.\\u2003Perhaps the most important feature of Combat Mission is its detailed and innovative portrayal of \"soft factors\". Experience, Morale, Leadership, and other elements operate at the individual soldier level and collectively transform how units behave. As important as these battlefield concerns are, most other games give them short shrift or don\\'t bother covering them at all. In the real world having the best weapons means nothing if the soldiers crewing them are balled up in fear or are too distracted to see what\\'s going on around them.HOW THINGS WORK BEHIND THE SCENESWeapon penetration values and armor protection are based on extremely detailed real life data and scientific algorithms that are specific to exactly what is seen in the game. There are no arbitrary values (hitpoints) or precalculated resolution tables (CRTs) that so often produce frustratingly inaccurate results. The advanced Tactical AI (TacAI) models the psychological state and inherent qualities of every soldier on the battlefield, allowing for genuine battlefield behavior from every soldier as if they were their own free thinking individual.\\u2003The simulation of independent soldiers is important in another regard because it allows Combat Mission to have what we call Relative Spotting. This is a system which ensures that each soldier has their own unique view of the battlefield, avoiding the \"Borg\" issue seen in many games where once one person has spotted an enemy, automatically everyone else has spotted it and can fire on it as well. Any wargamer worth his weight in gunpowder knows that Fog of War is one of the most important battlefield elements. An unprecedented simulation of Command and Control (C2) combines with Relative Spotting to realistically portray the flow of information and responsibility between soldiers as they share information with each other on what they can see on the battlefield\\u2003All of these elements, and many more, seamlessly fit together to create the most realistic battlefield experience out there. The realism level isn\\'t pushed in your face with lots of data and obscure references. Instead players experience all of this with the 3D graphical environment. Combat Mission\\'s visceral game environment is what attracts players, the richness of the gameplay is what keeps them playing for years on end.Features:- Tactical warfare at battalion and below scale in a true 3D environment- Command individual vehicles, teams, and squads- Expansive simulation of \"soft factors\" such as Morale, Experience, and Leadership- Innovative systems portraying Fog of War, Spotting, Line of Sight, Command & Control, and Objectives- Unmatched realistic physics, ballistics, and battlefield effects- Fight in a wide range of weather and lighting conditions, all of which realistically impact fighting abilities- Unique hybrid system for RealTime or WeGo (turn based) play- Full featured Editor for maps, scenarios, and campaigns- Quick Battle system sets up deliberate or randomized battles based on player specifications- Single player and head to head play, including Play By Email (PBEM)- Detailed and realistic combat formation for the United States Army and Syrian Army- Two types of Syrian Unconventional Forces, Spies, IEDs, and VIEDs- One large campaign, a small training campaign, 20 standalone scenarios, and numerous Quick Battle maps.- On map mortars, mortar vehicles, drones, anti-aircraft fire, and other modern warfare features- Expanded arid combat environment, now including waterways, bridges, and other new terrain- Intricately detailed and highly realistic combat equipment for the United States Army and Syrian Army, including 41 vehicles and 35 assorted small arms and crew weapons.- Expansive maps with 1m x 1m resolution allow for short and long range action across complex terrain- Buildings have explicitly simulated doors, windows, and floors- Weather and ground condition modelling systems allow for everything from dry sunny days to muddy stormy nights, with visibility and mobility dynamically affected by the conditions. Some Combat Mission games include the full range of Winter, Spring, and Fall weather as well- Line of Sight and Line of Fire are separately calculated, which means sometimes you can see something you can\\'t shoot and sometimes you can shoot at things you can\\'t see- Soldier posture (prone, kneeling, standing) affects everything including spotting, cover, and ability to engage enemies- Line of Sight is calculated from the \"eyeballs\" or \"sensor\" point, not a generic value- Much of Combat Mission\\'s realism comes from correctly simulating important low level details, such as crew responsibilities, vehicle vision blocks, high tech sensors, etc. A 3 man tank with a few cloudy vision blocks doesn\\'t have to be artificially made inferior to a 5 man tank with a commander\\'s cupola and separate vision blocks for the gunner and loader because in Combat Mission it happens naturally- The way a nation organizes its units has a huge impact on how they perform in combat, therefore great pains are taken to accurately portray formations as they are in real life for a particular point in time- Lighting affects combat in no small way in real life as well as in the game. The correct lighting conditions are simulated based on time of day, time of year, and weather',\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"About This ContentSilent Hill is a new Chapter for Dead by Daylight. It includes a Killer, The Executioner, a Survivor, Cheryl Mason, and a Map. Purchasing the add-on will unlock its new Killer, new Survivor, and an exclusive Universal Charm: the Seal of Metatron. The Silent Hill Chapter includes a new map, Midwich Elementary School:  the childhood trauma that once took place in its halls has since manifested itself into a twisted, nightmarish design.  The new Killer is The Executioner: take control of Pyramid Head and wield his great knife to unleash his twisted brand of punishment on all who cross him. The new Survivor is Cheryl Mason, a courageous, outspoken woman who survived the hellish Otherworld of Silent Hill, and exacted revenge on the Order that killed her father. With experience beyond her years, she's prepared to once again stand against any evil that confronts her. The ExecutionerA sadistic and merciless executioner, Pyramid Head is fixated on dispensing punishment through pain. Encumbered by the steel frame upon his head and with a hulking great blade in tow, he stalked the hellish corridors of Silent Hill, committed to a duty that no one truly understood. Where he trod, even monsters fled for the shadows, and those who crossed his path fell victim to unrestrained acts of aggression. When his duty was complete and his presence no longer needed, he prepared for the long rest—and yet, his skills were required elsewhere. The fog that streamed over him was somehow different than that he was accustomed to in Silent Hill, as if each wisp contained the nerves of a creature, writhing, seeking him out. There was an unspoken agreement in that moment. The billowing cloud was an invitation to duty and sadism, and Pyramid Head, taking a step into the fog, accepted his obligation once more. The Executioner’s Power: Rites of JudgementPress and hold the Power button to activate. Once activated, move in any direction to carve a trail into the ground. Release the button to finish carving. Survivors who walk or run on the trail will trigger Killer Instinct and be afflicted with Torment. Survivors under the effect of Torment may be sent to a Cage of Atonement by The Executioner while they are in the dying state. The Executioner comes with 3 new perks.Forced PenanceThose who stand in the way of duty will suffer harsh judgment. Survivors who take a protection hit are inflicted with the Broken status effect for 40/50/60 seconds.Trail of TormentYou guide your victims along a path of pain and punishment. After kicking a generator, you become Undetectable for 16/16/16 seconds. During this time, the generator’s yellow aura is revealed to Survivors. This effect can only trigger once every 80/70/60 seconds.DeathboundThose whose lives are intertwined in darkness are destined to suffer together. When a Survivor heals another Survivor for one health state at least 32/32/32 meters away from the Killer, the Survivor performing the healing action will scream, revealing their location and activating Deathbound for the next 60/60/60 seconds. During that time, the Survivor will suffer from the Oblivious status effect when further than 16/12/8 meters away from the healed Survivor. Cheryl MasonCaring and impulsive, Cheryl Mason, previously known as Heather, attempted to rebuild her life after the tragic death of her adoptive father, Harry Mason. While she had freed herself from the religious cult that pursued her since birth, she was shackled by the guilt of her father's death. A darkness punished her every night under the guise of abominable nightmares. To ease her conscience, she volunteered at a crisis intervention center for troubled youth. Three months later, she aced training and could answer the crisis line without supervision. Yet little could have prepared her for the first call. All she heard was static. The air thickened as black fumes rose from the ground and suddenly she heard the voice of a woman—someone she thought she'd never hear from again. Why do you cling to this corrupt world? You know that only God can save us. It couldn't be her—Claudia was dead. Suddenly, the world spun and she dropped on her knees, nauseous. Hot bile traveled up her throat and she retched warm blood on the floor. Then the spinning stopped as swiftly as it began. Cheryl looked up and saw she was somewhere else. A cold, hopeless place.  Cheryl comes with 3 new perks.Soul Guard You have been through immense hardship and you’re stronger for it. Gain the Endurance status effect for 4/6/8 seconds after being healed or having recovered from the dying state. During this time, any damage that will put you in the dying state will instead apply Deep Wounds. You have 20/20/20 seconds to mend yourself. If you take any damage while affected by Deep Wounds, or if the timer ends, you are immediately put in the dying state. While cursed by a hex, you can fully recover from the dying state.Blood PactIt’s as if a latent part of yourself has awakened. You feel like you can reach out beyond yourself for assistance. When you or the Obsession are injured, you both see each other's auras. After healing the Obsession or being healed by the Obsession, you both gain a 7/7/7% Haste status effect for 6/8/10 seconds. Reduces the odds of being the Obsession. If you are the Obsession, this perk deactivates.Repressed AllianceYou’re accustomed to being hunted by malicious forces, and you’ve begun using it to your advantage. Repressed Alliance activates after repairing generators for a total of 80/70/60 seconds. When repairing a generator while the perk is active, press the Active Ability button to call upon the Entity to block the generator for 30/30/30 seconds. The perk deactivates. Affected generators will be revealed by a white aura to all Survivors.New Map: Midwich Elementary SchoolTo students who were bullied by their teachers and classmates, attending Midwich Elementary School was comparable to torture. As the Order’s grip on the town’s supernatural energies tightened, a transformation occurred. The childhood trauma that took place in the building manifested itself into a twisted, nightmarish design. Though desks and textbooks remain, they’re eerily contrasted with stained walls, rusted chains, and hanging cadavers. Any notion that this could have been a place of innocence and learning has long since faded. Exclusive CharmThe Silent Hill Chapter includes an exclusive item: the Seal of Metatron, a Universal Charm, only available as part of the DLC. Please note that this item cannot be purchased separately.\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"SpyParty is a competitive espionage game about human behavior, performance, perception, and deception. While most spy games have you machine-gunning stuff, blowing things up, and driving fast, SpyParty has you hide in plain sight, blend into a high-society cocktail party, deceive your opponent, and detect subtle behavioral tells to achieve your objectives and not get shot. Finally you can be like the suave and confident spies you find in films or books, risking it all by doing the final mission right in front of the sniper as the clock runs out! There are plenty of games that explore being a super-powered commando with an infinite supply of ammunition and no brains; SpyParty is a new and quite different game about the more interesting, deeper, and more subtle aspects of being a spy.The current main gameplay mode is 1v1 Spy versus Sniper online multiplayer, although there is limited single-player Sniper play right now, and a single player Spy and Sniper practice mode for trying out missions and whatnot.See the SpyParty Steam Discussions for  an FAQ and links to more information.If you're wondering where the MacOS X port went, see that FAQ! I need to delay it until after SEA launch because I hit a few technical snags, but the non-Steam MacOS will continue to work, and I'll get it working on Steam soon after SEA launch hopefully!\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"War of Rights is a multiplayer game set during the perilous days of the American Civil War, in the Maryland Campaign of September, 1862. Campfire Games is devoted to presenting the gruesome and glorious elements of the period, while maintaining the highest level of historical accuracy and realism as is possible with the wonders of CRYENGINE. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀- Massive battles: Take part in engagements consisting of 150 players.- Tailored for line formation teamplay: Custom formation buff mechanic system rewards sticking together by lessening the suppression effects, the morale cost for the team when dying and the flag bearer respawn rate.- Multiple army branches: Fall in on the line as an infantryman or shatter the fighting spirit of the enemy as an artillery crewman!- Historical accuracy: Period correct uniforms, weapons, manual of arms animations, battlefields, objectives & drill camps.- Regimental pride: 135 researched and recreated regiments & batteries all supporting uniforms for all ranks (Private to Colonel) and player classes.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀- Immersive communication: In-game 3D voice system.- Recreated battlefields: More than 30 historically accurate skirmish areas of the Battles of Antietam and South Mountain as well as the Siege of Harpers Ferry to play on and three drill camps to perfect your formation forming abilities or simply exchange battle stories at the campfire.- Player classes: Private, NCO, Flag Bearer & Officer playable from every regiment & battery featured and covering all ranks from Private to Colonel.- Community focus: A strong company (player organized clans) focus with a dedicated company tool and forum sections devoted to in-game event creation.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀- Powerful game engine: Powered by CRYENGINE V, War of Rights is capable of providing visuals unmatched by any other Civil War game.- More than a game: War of Rights is a vision that keeps expanding its scale. The project is entirely crowdfunded and has been developed on for the past 6 years. We consider it more of an ever evolving artistic piece rather than a final product with a targeted release deadline with set features.Players in the game will be able to play on multiple battlefields of the campaign, from the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers where the Siege of Harper's Ferry took place, to the ridgelines of South Mountain, and to the meandering waters of Antietam Creek at the Battle of Antietam. Additionally, players will also be able to choose from a list of regiments that fought in each battle as well as what rank to fight as, whether they want to slog it out as a lowly private, or if you want to orchestrate the carnage and mayhem as a major general. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Uniforms and bodily features will all be customizable for other players to see as you march and fight in the lines of battle according to the tactics of the period. As a General, you will operate in your headquarters equipped with a map of the battlefield and constantly receiving reports of friendly and enemy positions. Send out new orders to the regiments to move forward, or fall back - all in real time. The orders will move down the chain of command, to the Colonels, Majors, down to the Captains in charge of the individual regiments, all of whom have the option to follow the orders of their trusted commander, or rebel against his wishes and fight as you see fit. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Each map contains a period reconstruction of the buildings, farms, forests, roads, and rocks as they were in 1862 so players can fight through the streets of Harper's Ferry, in the wooded heights of Fox's Gap at South Mountain, or in the cornfields and Bloody Lanes of Antietam. Players can feel the whiz of deadly shot and shell fly by their bodies, or hit their comrades or themselves as they scream in a bloody hail from their wounds. Limbs will fly and blood will be spilt once again as Campfire Games brings the fighting of the Civil War right to the player's computer screen! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Will you heed the Union call against the traitors? Or will you fight to defend your family and livelihood with the Confederacy? You decide!⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀We thought it a good idea to recreate/repost our Early Access roadmap as a lot of players having joined us recently are unlikely to know what we are intending to offer as the game advances in its development. The below roadmap should be taken for what it is - a preliminary list of things we have planned for. As all plans are subject to change, there is a great chance that the list will also end up changing, however.The order of the roadmap is also subject to change as the development moves ahead. Some things listed may arrive a great deal sooner or later than what their listing order indicates.1. Bug fixes, stability improvements: This will be an ongoing focus throughout the development of the game. An alpha is never without its bugs. New content rarely comes without its fair share of bugs and issues required to fix up.2. Performance improvements: We are well aware of the performance of the alpha is needing to be improved - especially at higher playercounts. Major programming work is currently going into reworking the most expensive part of the game at high playercounts. Once finished you should all be experiencing much better framerates on populated servers.3. Expanded server moderation tools: This will allow server administrators more control to manage and configure their server using commands such as: kick,ban,change map, change skirmish area, change weather and time of day.4. End game events: Taken out just before the launch on Early Access, the end game events will be making a comeback in a more fleshed out form, specifically designed to create more memorable end game moments in cases where the question of who were the winners of the match is heavily contested.5. Improved melee: Melee is going to be receiving a much needed overhaul, including the availability of a parry move and animation kill sequences between two players (“kill-moves”) to increase the visual fidelity of close quarter fighting.6. New battlefields: The Battles of South Mountain and Shepherdstown will eventually complete the Maryland Campaign of 1862.7. Fleshed out officer order system: Additional officer commands will be introduced to allow for a greater range of tactical options.8. Musicians: Working in tandem with the officer order system, musicians will have to relay the correct calls to help make sure the orders are received down the line.9. Historical Battles mode: Besides the quicker Skirmish mode, the largest and main game mode intended for the game, known as Historical Battles, would open up the entirety of the 4x4 km battlefields for more of a complete playthrough, with a moving frontline consisting of several capture areas. This will also entail the use of the full chain of command where players take the part of Generals, using maps and couriers to direct troops across the huge battlefield.10. Player controlled artillery: The many batteries already placed on the battlefields will become player controlled once we introduce an artillery system, where players will have access to some of the most destructive and tide-turning weapons of war.11. Generals: The chain of command on the battlefield will be expanded with the addition of generals. Generals bring a tactical overview to the battle that all other classes lack, helping to command the troops when using the historical battles mode, helping to bring some order to the chaos of war.12. Cavalry: Horses are to be implemented for both cavalry units, moving artillery pieces, as well as for the high command and their couriers. The cavalry was still an important branch of the armies of the period considering the changes in technology, acting as reconnaissance and quick response units as understandings for their use developed over the period of the war.13. Final Release: Once the above features have been finished, we will be at the point that we would be just about ready for full release of the game to all and sundry! This final release would also be the point that those that had backed us originally would be getting their promised physical and digital goods. While we cannot give any definite date as to when we might get to release, we inch closer every day!\",\n",

The time has come to stake your claim on the Red Planet and build the first functioning human colonies on Mars!  All you need are supplies, oxygen, decades of training, experience with sandstorms, and a can-do attitude to discover the purpose of those weird black cubes that appeared out of nowhere. With a bit of sprucing up, this place is going to be awesome!  Surviving Mars is a sci-fi city builder all about colonizing Mars and surviving the process. Choose a space agency for resources and financial support before determining a location for your colony. Build domes and infrastructure, research new possibilities and utilize drones to unlock more elaborate ways to shape and expand your settlement. Cultivate your own food, mine minerals or just relax by the bar after a hard day’s work. Most important of all, though, is keeping your colonists alive. Not an easy task on a strange new planet. There will be challenges to overcome. Execute your strategy and improve your colony’s chances of survival while unlocking the mysteries of this alien world. Are you ready? Mars is waiting for you. Main Features:Building on a planet not fit for human life challenges you to build a smart, functional colony. Bad planning isn’t about traffic jams, it’s about survival of your colonists. You really don’t want rolling blackouts in a city constructed in a place without oxygen. Each colonist is a unique individual with problems and strengths that influence the needs and behavior of the other colonists. Things can get really interesting if your chief scientists develops alcoholism after one too many long nights in the lab. Retro-futuristic super structures housing colonists, factories and commercial buildings with their own “neighborhood personality.” Create colonies that value science over everything else, while tired workers drink their pay away at a local bar, or attempt a utopia among the stars.  Inspired by the classic sci-fi of Asimov and Clarke, Surviving Mars holds many secrets. During each playthrough players may encounter one of Mars’ individually crafted mysteries. Uncovering these secrets might bring your colony great fortune, or terrible ruin. What is that sphere that manifested itself outside colony HUB B, and is it friendly?  Combine static and random research through experimentation, which allows for a different experience for each journey through the game. Attain new scientific breakthroughs by exploring the uncharted terrain of Mars's surface.A sleek, modern take on the bright futurism of the 1960s. A time of exploration and adventure.Craft your own fantastic buildings, parks or even a mystery to share through Surviving Mars’s extensive and convenient modding tools. Share your finest creations with the community to build the perfect society.\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': 'About This ContentWhat if humanity suddenly encounters extraterrestrial intelligence on Earth? Bohemia Interactive presents: Arma 3 Contact – a spin-off expansion about the most important discovery in the history of mankind. As a soldier deployed to Livonia’s militarized Nadbór region, you will be among the first to study our alien visitors and determine their intentions. However, amid the tension and chaos, armed conflict inevitably unfolds. Arma 3 Contact’s military science fiction campaign arrives together with a massive new terrain, and introduces new factions, weapons, vehicles, outfits, equipment, and more to the wider Arma 3 sandbox.Key FeaturesSingleplayer Campaign \"First Contact\"Ever fantasize about what would happen if aliens arrive on Earth? The story-driven “First Contact” campaign places you right at the center of a mysterious event that will forever change the face of human history. As Specialist Aiden Rudwell, you are a NATO drone operator taking part in a military training exercise on Livonia. When a massive alien vessel enters the atmosphere, you are sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate the extraterrestrial presence. The priority: to learn who or what they are, and find out why they are here. However, with our very existence in the balance, different interpretations fueled by a region-wide blackout quickly prove to be a surefire way to conflict. Over the course of this campaign, you will engage in field science, electronic warfare, and combat recon, in an experience delivered in authentic Arma 3 style.Livonia TerrainDense forests, wide open fields, and plenty of interesting landmarks – get ready to explore a fresh temperate summer environment ideally suited for combined arms warfare. Arma 3 Contact’s 163 km2 Eastern European terrain covers the partly abandoned Nadbór region within the larger Polish-speaking country of Livonia. This landlocked NATO member state shares borders with four other nations, including the Russian exclave Kaliningrad and CSAT partner Belarus, which inherently makes it a place of great geo-strategic importance. Its woodland locale is composed of a big set of completely new structures, props, and natural objects, complemented by objects from other Bohemia terrains.2 FactionsWith the new terrain come two relatively smaller but highly capable new military factions. Specifically, the Livonian Defense Force and Russian Spetsnaz. The LDF equips its soldiers with high-end protective gear in a distinctive woodland ‘geometric’ camouflage design. This includes new fatigues, plate carrier vests, and advanced modular combat helmets with optional ear protectors and so-called ‘Spartan chops’. Meanwhile, the Russian Spetsnaz operators wear a new lightweight two-tone suit, a durable helmet based on CSAT design, and a chest rig which sports a cross-drawn chest holder for sidearms. Each faction is further enhanced by reskinned variants of existing Arma 3 assets, and made complete with new character faces and Polish or Russian radio protocols.5 WeaponsThe Contact expansion adds 5 weapons to your Arma 3 arsenal. The LDF makes use of the Promet Assault Rifle. This modular bullpup rifle is known for its unique detachable carry handle with integrated scope and can be fitted with an under-barrel grenade launcher or shotgun attachment. Then there are two additions to the AK family, which are primarily used by Russian Spetsnaz. The RPK-12 Light Machine Gun features a distinctive 75-round drum magazine, elongated barrel, a modified stock, and added foregrip. The AKU-12 Rifle is a lightweight carbine with a shorter barrel and a special muzzle brake. Lastly, Livonia’s civilian hunting enthusiasts bring in their own two weapons. The Mk14 Classic Hunting Rifle is a single fire walnut stock version of the military-issue Mk14, while the Kozlice Shotgun is a traditional break-barrel 12 gauge that can fire slug or buckshot shells, and comes in a regular and sawed-off variant.2 VehiclesSay hello to an unlikely pair of new vehicles. First up is the ED-1 Mini UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle). This small tracked electric robot is built to traverse complex terrain, and can transmit a live camera feed so that its operator can remotely assess the situation. Wielding its multi-joint swivel arm, the UGV’s two primary uses are CBRN Defense and Explosive Ordnance Disposal. The Science variant, the ED-1E*, is essentially a driving laboratory with sensors, a sampling laser, and a biopsy probe. For military use, the ED-1D variant comes prepared with a mounted Disruptor shotgun; ideal for demining operations and close encounters. On the opposite side of the vehicle spectrum drives the Tractor. This reliable Diesel workhorse from Arma 2 returns with a major upgrade to its model and textures, and might prove unexpectedly useful in certain circumstances.Gear*In response to First Contact, this spin-off expansion also hands you a variety of new gear. Perhaps most striking is the equipment related to CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) defense. This involves an oversuit – available in multiple colors and camouflage designs – and includes Air Purifying Respirator face masks and breathing apparatus backpacks. Another notable addition is the Spectrum Device. This is a handheld transceiver that can act as an electromagnetic spectrum analyzer. It can send and receive a myriad of signals at various frequencies, while – depending on what antenna is fitted – it can also be used for jamming or deception. As such, it is essential when it comes to scientific study, communications, or engaging in electronic warfare. Additionally, there is a radio backpack, prisoner blindfold, and, of course, the most proven measure of defense against alien interference: the tin foil hat.Classified IntelLittle is known about the extraterrestrial visitors, but their largest observed vessel is hard to miss. Presumably employing a form of gravity control, it appears to have little trouble maintaining levitation despite its massive size. It is unclear whether Livonia is the only arrival site on Earth, but the UFO is believed to purposely hover above an underground alien network that spans at least several kilometers. This network’s purpose and origin are entirely unknown, but it appears to be incredibly old since it has gone unnoticed for the longest time. Recent reports also mention sightings of highly advanced car-sized alien entities surveying the UFO’s nearby environment. However, much more information is needed before their true capabilities and purpose can be evaluated.Additional Multiplayer ScenariosJump into Arma 3’s official Zeus Game Master, Combat Patrol, and Warlords multiplayer modes with additional scenarios for the new Livonia terrain.Free Bonus ContentThe Arma 3 Contact spin-off expansion is supported by free new content for all Arma 3 owners.NATO Woodland Camouflage - NATO troops receive a modest range of gear in woodland camouflage, fitting for Livonia’s forest terrain.Civilian Clothing - Additional character gear helps represent the various civilian groups in the Nadbór region, such as the international Astra scientists, local farmers, and looters.100+ Decorative & Terrain Objects* - Content creators can let their imagination run wild with dozens of new structures and props, many of which are available in multiple color variants. Besides the new assets for the Livonia terrain, this includes objects related to CBRN (sealed transport packaging, a weather station, and more), Decontamination (tents, showers, spill bunds, cleaning equipment, tarps, liquid hoses, and more) and Field Outposts (rugged equipment, terminals, furniture, lamps, solar panels, power cables, cargo platforms, and more).Official Soundtrack - Listen to new music tracks composed specifically for the \"First Contact\" singleplayer campaign.* Some of these marked items might have advanced scripted gameplay functionality within Arma 3 Contact’s singleplayer campaign. However, please be aware that they are purely cosmetic and/or decorative when used across the vanilla Arma 3 sandbox, such as in multiplayer or in the Scenario Editor.Launch OptionsTo play the \"First Contact\" singleplayer campaign, you should open the Arma 3 Launcher and then hit the PLAY CONTACT button. Alternatively, you can visit the DLC section in the Arma 3 Launcher, load Arma 3 Contact there, and launch the game by clicking on the regular PLAY button. If you would like to play regular Arma 3 but still want to have access to the assets from the Contact expansion (such as the terrain, weapons, and vehicles), you can simply launch Arma 3 without loading Arma 3 Contact as optional DLC.New to Arma 3?If you’re interested in Arma 3 Contact but do not yet own the Arma 3 base game, we recommend purchasing the Arma 3 Contact Edition. This includes the Contact expansion plus the Arma 3 base game at a much lower price than when both are bought separately. Of course, if you want to experience everything Arma 3 has to offer, you might also consider purchasing the Arma 3 Ultimate Edition, which bundles the Arma 3 base game and all DLC packs (including the Arma 3 Contact expansion) at a heavily discounted price.',\n",

       "  'full_bio': 'About This ContentStranger Things is a brand-new Chapter for Dead by Daylight. The Stranger Things Chapter includes a new map, the Underground Complex, located below the Hawkins National Laboratory. A Demogorgon is the new untamable Killer. Against the Demogorgon stands not one, but two new Survivors: Nancy Wheeler, a tough aspiring journalist, and Steve Harrington, a former high school jock with a knack for finding trouble. The Stranger Things Chapter also features two exclusive cosmetic items: Steve’s Scuffed Rolled Sleeves and Nancy’s Torn Sweatshirt.It was the early 1980s, a time of cold war experiments and naive fascination, a time of stranger things. In the small town of Hawkins, Indiana, covert experiments were being conducted. When an inter-dimensional gate was accidentally opened at the Hawkins National Laboratory, an army of creatures with long, curved claws and gaping faces that bloom like horrific flowers was unleashed. These creatures were labeled “Demogorgons” by a group of local kids who encountered them. Nancy Wheeler’s knack for investigative journalism first emerged when she brought down a secret government organization in Hawkins following the disappearance of her closest friend, Barb. Her being fired from the Hawkins Post during the summer of 1985 has not dissuaded Nancy from chasing leads...Formerly a popular jock, Steve Harrington, is struggling to find his place in Hawkins now that high school is over, and his old friends moved away to college. Since then, he’s spent his time scooping ice cream at the mall, flirting with girls, and cracking secret Russian codes. With the help of his friends Dustin and Robin, Steve is carving out a new identity for himself and learning what true friendship really means. It’s this newfound loyalty to his friends that compels Steve to come to the aid of his ex-girlfriend, Nancy when he suspects she might be in terrible danger... The DemogorgonA blooming mouth full of needle-like teeth for a face, large, curved, razor-sharp claws, and powerful legs to pounce on victims, make the Demogorgon a frightening monster to face in any dimension. It is a nightmare of unrestrained, feral rage as it hunts down its prey and rips it to pieces, devouring every last morsel of flesh and gore, leaving nothing for scavengers. The creature is untouched by any sense of compassion or restraint. Looming over its victim, it shows no doubt or mercy, just the pure instinct of its insatiable bloodlust as it delivers the deathblow. A perfect hunter, the Demogorgon is a macabre testament to the horrors lurking in the Upside Down and why it was choice pickings for The Entity.The Demogorgon’s Power: Of the AbyssThe Demogorgon impacts the environment close to generators, affects nearby Survivors, and uses Portals to travel quickly. The Demogorgon starts with a limited number of Portals that can spawn on any flat floor or ground.  The Demogorgon comes with 3 new perks.SurgeYour eerie presence charges the air and interferes with technology. Downing a Survivor instantly explodes and places a regression effect on any generators within range. The generator is also instantly regressed. “The creature appears to have some unknown influence over electricity and nearby electronics.”— Hawkins National LaboratoryCruel LimitsYour ties to the otherworldly manifest when your prey attempts to get away. Each time a generator is fixed, vaulting is blocked for the Survivors close to that generator for a short time. “The specimen seems to able to affect the state of nearby objects, as if they existed in some other form within a dimension alternate to our own.”— Hawkins National LaboratoryMindbreakerYour distressing presence drains and weakens your prey. While repairing a generator, Survivors are afflicted by the Exhaustion Status effect. The Exhaustion Status effect pauses while fixing a generator and re-starts after ending the repair action. −\"The specimen can evoke feelings of dread and fatigue in nearby individuals.\" — Hawkins National LaboratoryStudious and rebellious, Nancy Wheeler is a stubborn investigator with an instinct for a good story. When her closest friend, Barb went missing, she did everything she could to unravel the truth and secure justice. A brilliant journalist, she chases stories and follows leads despite the inequality and chauvinism she encounters at the workplace. Pursuing a lead one evening, she fearlessly approaches the Hawkins National Laboratory before suddenly losing consciousness. A moment later she awakens in a strange misty realm with the sound of a familiar roar echoing through the air.Nancy Wheeler comes with 3 new perks.Better Together You seek justice and uncover the truth no matter what obstacle stands in your way. The aura of the generator being repaired is revealed to other Survivors within range. If the Killer downs a Survivor while you are repairing a generator, the Killer’s and Survivors’ auras are revealed to you briefly. − “Let’s burn that lab to the ground.”—Nancy WheelerFixatedWhen you have a goal in mind, there’s no turning back: better to ask forgiveness than permission. You can see your own scratch marks at all time. When your health is full, you can walk faster than normal. − “I wanna finish what we started. I want to kill it.\"—Nancy WheelerInner StrengthYou look inward and trust your instincts when you feel lost and alone. When you complete a cleanse Totem action, the Perk activates. Once activated, you self-heal when entering a locker. “All this time I’ve been trying so hard to pretend like everything’s fine, but it’s not.”—Nancy Wheeler  Popular and arrogant, yet compassionate, Steve Harrington is an unlikely mentor and leader. He often acts as a surrogate big brother to a younger boy named Dustin. He even helped him find his slimy inter-dimensional pet Demogorgon, D’Artagnan.  His reputation as a protector grew and he soon became a sort of ‘babysitter’ for a group of kids in Hawkins with a knack for messing around with strange and dangerous things. His courage is unmatched so that he was even able to fend off a Demogorgon when it threatened his friends. One evening he received a call for assistance from his friend Nancy Wheeler. He drove all the way to the Hawkins National Laboratory to see if she was okay. He searched the area but only found her notebook. Before he realized what was happening, the ground opened up and a swirl of black mist filled his eyes. When he awakened he was in a strange place that seemed familiar but unfamiliar at the same time.Steve Harrington comes with 3 new perks.BabysitterWhile you have a reputation for being self-centered, you risk it all to help those in need.  The Survivor you unhook leaves no blood trail or scratch marks for a short amount of time. Also, both you and the Killer can briefly see each other’s aura. −“I promised to keep you shitheads safe, and that’s exactly what I plan on doing.” —Steve HarringtonCamaraderieLife has taught you the importance of friendship which has given you strength. If a Survivor comes within range of your hook while you are struggling, the Struggle Phase timer pauses briefly. – “So, remember once you get in there… pretend like you don’t care. There you go, you’re learning my friend. You’re learning.”—Steve HarringtonSecond WindYou have learned to avoid awkward situations with parents. Part of you still thinks your best option is to run away and hope things will take care of themselves. Heal a Survivor to activate this perk. Once activated you self-heal after unhooking yourself or being unhooked by a Survivor when you are outside the Terror Radius. Once fully healed the perk deactivates. −“Yeah, that’s a no.\"—Steve HarringtonNew Map: The Underground ComplexLocated below of the Hawkins National Laboratory, this underground complex released dozens of inter-dimensional creatures in November 1984 before the rift was sealed. The site includes an isolation tank and equipment once used by government officials to conduct mind control experiments on test subjects. Now the walls of the abandoned facility are sprayed with bullets and blood, evidence of the battle against the creatures.Exclusive Items for Nancy and SteveStranger Things Chapter includes two exclusive items: Steve’s Scuffed Rolled Sleeves and Nancy’s Torn Sweatshirt.  These are only available as part of the DLC. Please note that this item cannot be purchased separately.',\n",

Competitors from all eras slug it out in devious and challenging arenas. Every match is an epic test of skill, speed, and strength, and every victory brings additional glory and bragging rights to the winners. Clockwork VALKRIs salt these slugfests with powerful weapons and gadgets. Fighters scramble to grab swords, axes, hammers, blasters, rocket lances and more! Every weapon changes your play style and your options. Gadgets like mines, bombs, and spiked spheres add even more danger into the mix, letting fighters change the course of battle with a well timed-throw or carefully laid trap. Brawlhalla is a free to play, 2D platform fighting game featuring both online and local singleplayer/ co-op modes.Online Team Brawl - The most popular format, two teams of up to four warriors face off in a frenetic, no holds barred brawl. Online Ranked 1v1 - A personal test of skill where you match up against a single opponent to claim untold levels of personal glory in Brawlhalla. Online Ranked 2v2 - Bolster your ranks with a friend to prove your mettle, wit and teamwork in frenetic 2v2 battles. 4 Player Online Free for All - Ranked or casual matches where four fighters enter, but only one can win. 8 Player 4v4 & FFA - Because the only thing better than four legends vying for bragging rights is eight legends battling for bragging rights. Local Free for All - Up to 4 players can play in free for all mode on one computer - perfect for friendly face-offs. Local Custom Teams - Team-up on your local machine, by adding up to 4 bots into the mix for living-room level mayhem.Alternate Game Modes - Brawlball, Bombsketball and more provide ‘casual’ ‘party game’ ‘just for fun’ alternate game modes with completely different objectives and just as much competition.Brawlhalla will always be 100% free to play, with no pay-to-win advantages and no in-game purchases to keep you from the action. We’re always listening to community feedback and value what players are telling us. Throughout Early Access and Open Beta, the Brawlhalla community helped steer the direction of development multiple times to make Brawlhalla the best it can be. Since launch, that has and will remain the same as we continue to improve, expand, and adjust Brawlhalla.\",\n",

Inspired by story generator games like Rimworld and Dwarf Fortress, weaving tales of both anguish and humor is central to Ruinarch’s gameplay. The game gives you all the infernal tools you'll need to toy with people's lives and relationships.There are many ways to be evil. Choose from three overlord Archetypes - each one provides you with a different playstyle. Do you want to focus on sheer destruction or are you into a more subtle puppetmaster approach? You can then customize it further by adding optional abilities to suit your own preferences.You can experiment by combining destructive spells. The most straightforward way to wipe out villagers is to simply cast powerful spells like Meteors, Earthquakes, Fire Balls, Lightning and more. But what happens when you hurl a meteor at a poisonous puddle? Poisonous meteor explosions, that's what! And that's just one of the many nefarious ways that you can combine elemental interactions to create your personalized cocktail of destruction!You can activate artifacts.Sometimes, the procedurally generated world will have some powerful artifacts for you to play with. If you find a Necronomicon, gift it to an evil villager to turn him into a Necromancer and let him terrorize the villagers himself. But be careful because some artifacts can also be used against you!You can afflict villagers with flaws.Sure, you could just destroy the world with ice and fire, but the real fun begins when you meddle with villager lives to put them into compelling and tragic situations! Afflict the local hero with Lycanthropy and watch as his once loyal friends turn on him when the full moon rises. Afflict an annoying husband with Unfaithfulness and then watch the fireworks once you tell his wife of his misdeeds.You can breed and spawn monsters.You can seize a roaming monster and then breed it in your Kennel. This will allow you to summon a copy of it anywhere in the world. Your corrupted versions behave differently from their wild counterparts as they have been bred to perform very specific functions.You can spread malicious info.Your Eye Structure allows you to gather information about major events that occur in the world. You've seen a Knight steal a Shaman's Potion? Store it as an Intel and then tell the Shaman about it!You can summon lesser demons.There are many demons in the netherworld ready to assist you. Wrath Demons can be used to invade villages while Sloth Demons can defend your demonic structures. In total, there are seven different demon types - each one representing a deadly sin. But be wary! Once they perish, you have to wait until they fully recuperate before summoning again.You can brainwash folks into becoming cultists.Seize a villager and drop it on your Defiler. There, you can start to brainwash it. If successful, it will return to its village as a secret cultist who will quietly worship and aid you.You can torture people.You can build a Prison and incarcerate villagers. If necessary, you can torture them in ridiculous ways to afflict them with random flaws. Perhaps someone will have a mental breakdown and become a Serial Killer when it gets back to its village?You can start a zombie apocalypse.You can afflict a peasant with a Zombie Virus. When it dies, it will reanimate at nightfall as a Zombie. Other villagers that it attacks may also contract the virus. Soon, the entire village will be filled with nothing but shambling zombies.You can start an epidemic.Too soon? But, yes you can.\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"UBOATUBOAT is a simulator of a submarine from WWII era, yet different than all you have seen so far. It is a survival sandbox with crew management mechanics while its primary theme is life of German sailors. The boat is their home, but it can become their grave at any time.In UBOAT you control the crew in order to control the boat. You look after their physical and mental health, because if the sailors are hungry, tired and their spirit is low, there’s no chance of winning even a skirmish.SurvivalThe extensive damage system is a foundation of the game's survival elements. Unprecedented situations are bound to happen as the effect of received damage, testing player's creativity and ability to stay calm. You can try to save the whole crew or leave someone behind, to save the others.While your ship travels through the open seas, you will often find yourself being on your own. Use your management skills to spend resources taken on the trip optimally and in special cases try to recover them on the sea, by asking your allies for the help... or by looting wreckages of enemy ships. Disable unnecessary devices, to keep your accumulators running for longer. Tell your crew to stay in their bunks to preserve oxygen. If crew's morale is low - play with them a session of Skat or play music from nearby radio stations, to fortify their hearts.Kriegsmarine careerDuring the playthrough you will receive assignments from the Kriegsmarine headquarters. They are never linear and you may receive additional orders during them or face unexpected problems.Brave completion of assignments from the headquarters is rewarded with additional budget for the unit under your command and with acceptance of your growing reputation as an u-boat's skipper. You will need that, to upgrade your ship and keep up with enemy's technological advances. Upgrade your boat for the rewarded funds. Receive additional permissions for the reputation points. Buy new equipment - new torpedo types, sonar decoys, CO2 absorbers and much more. Send your officers on special tasks in the headquarters to, among other things, speed up a research of new technologies.Accurate simulationGame's simulation elements are very realistic, but that never comes at a cost of gameplay quality. Despite extensive simulation elements, UBOAT can be played like a regular game and complex matters can be learned later to become a better skipper for the commanded unit.Even small things like the influence of ballast in each compartment on the ship's trim (tilt) or Earth's curvature are faithfully reproduced in the game.Perfection can be achieved in many ways. Prove your management skills and swiftly assign work to your officers to speed things up. If, on the other hand, you think that if something needs to be done, it's better to do that on your own - sit behind the periscope, hydrophone or 88 mm deck gun and take matters in your own hands!\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': 'Naval Action is a hardcore, realistic, and beautifully detailed naval combat game immersing players into the experience of the most beautiful period of naval history - when sailing ships ruled the seas. No game has come closer to the replication of the Age of Sail sailing mechanics and combat. Naval action was named one of the best releases from early access in 2019 by Steam and Steam community.Here is what you can expect:Beautiful ships – We have been painstakingly recreating the beautiful ships of the Age of sail period. Accurate hull models, sail plans, guns, internal upgrades, historical speed trials were used in the creation of vessels. The game features 50+ ships from small cutters to large 100+ gun 1st rates allowing the player to experience every possible role of that era.Conquest and PVP ActivitiesFight on War Server – Fight for the domination of the West Indies, recreated based on 18th Century maps and navigational charts. Build ships, trade, attack enemies of your nation almost everywhere and capture their ships. Open trading outposts and levy taxes in the ports governed by your clan. Invest to turn your controlled ports into industrial hubs, shipbuilding arsenals or fortified harbours. Invite other clans of your nation into your alliance.Built for PVPAge of sail combat is a personal affair with no dirty tricks, corner camping, or hiding in bushes: you see the enemy from 20km and so do they. Just like in boxing you have to get close; and use all your tactical knowledge of wind, your ship to slug it out face to face. Broadside weight matters, but even a smaller vessel can overcome the superior enemy by focusing on the enemy weak spots.Absolutely no hackers.Hacking is a killer of fun in PVP games. From the start we have build the tech around one main goal - complete elimination of hacking from PVP. We are very proud to say that we have succeeded. Naval Action is one of the few games where hacking is made impossible by design. Every battle action is calculated on the servers, even water and wave shapes. Yes - you have heard it right: there is a special server that calculates and replicates waves to all users in battle. When fighting in Naval action you can be sure you are only facing skills and ship fittings.Other activitiesRelax on Peace Server - All nations are at peace and players cannot attack each other in Peace servers. There are no port battles and conquest, piracy or privateering. All ships can be captured from the NPCs. Peace servers are perfect for friendly peaceful gameplay.Tutorials – In-game tutorials and exams help you to grasp the basics and the subtleties of gunnery and maneuvering. Passing the final naval combat exam grants you the rank of Master and Commander, together with a frigate and other rewards to start your adventures in the West Indies.Admiralty missions – Accomplish missions for your Admiralty to earn doubloons, combat medals and reward chests. Deliver cargo or passengers, hunt specific ships, join patrol zones battles and sink as many ships as you can.Trading and privateering – Buy trading goods at low prices, haul them to distant places for high profits. Board ships and sell them and their cargo at nearby ports. Use shallow waters at your advantage to escape from larger ships.Shipbuilding and manufacturing - Build ships, upgrades and cannons, supply your clans or your nation or set up shops in free towns to sell to your enemies.  FeaturesRealistic sailing – Advanced wind and physics model provides for realistic portrayal of ship’s performance in the age of sail. Yard angles, ship angle to wind, fittings and ship condition affects speeds and turning rates. Correct tacking, boxhauling, clubhauling and other elements of realistic sailing will help you win battles in most adverse conditions. Gunnery and weapons –  Major types of naval artillery are implemented: from long guns to mortars to carronades and obusiers. Fort and land batteries will provide you with support during battles near shores. Mortar vessels can destroy fortifications, though they may require an escort. Each gun has realistic ballistics and penetration performance based on historical gun charts and admiralty tests.. Heel and wind affects the shooting distance and will require a change in tactics. Damage model – Every cannonball is tracked in the air and after it hits the target. Leaks, structural damage, torn sails, demasting, raking, fires, explosions and all other hazards that were possible in that era. Damage is positional: hit the gun and you might destroy it. Gunnery crews are placed deck by deck. Shot can pass through the balcony, ricochet of the gun, hit a crew member and then fly out of the gunport splashing into the water. Armor thickness and wood types affect strength of the hull and cannonballs will ricochet from the hulls at extreme angles. Customization – Choose economy and battle perks as you progress through higher ranks. Find knowledge books in enemy vessels and build upgrades to improve the performance of your ship. Loot or craft the shipbuilding woods that fit the characteristics you want to give to your future ship. Woods used for crafting of upgrades and equipment',\n",

Combat The city is crawling with enemies who want you dead and your parkour skills will help you defeat them. You can sneak up on bad guys and dispatch them quietly, or fight openly in pitched battles. When there are too many bad guys to take on all at once, use the terrain to your advantage and pick them off one by one. No matter what your fighting style though, expert marksmanship is a must.A note on motion sicknessTesting has shown that Stride VR does not cause significant motion sickness. The gameplay has been designed such that the player’s hand movements coincide with his avatar’s movements. This means that the load on the player’s vestibular apparatus is kept to a minimum. Although most people do feel minor uneasiness when they first start playing the game, as you master the controls, motion sickness disappears entirely.',\n",

It is a lifeless realm of endless dunes, stained red from the blood of savages and barbarians. This is the Land of the Dead, where mummified kings are cursed to rule in perpetual unlife. But it was not always thus.There was a time when the ancient kingdom of Nehekhara stood as a crown of human civilisation; a golden age when its cities shone with majestic splendour, its armies conquered entire nations and its kings ruled as gods among men. But this realm was razed millennia ago by the treacherous sorcery of reviled Nagash: in a stroke, the living perished and the dead rose from their tombs.Death is no barrier to glory for the Tomb Kings however. In unlife, they will see the empire of Nehekhara restored to greatness! Campaign gameplayObjectives While Tomb Kings can be played in the Eye of the Vortex campaign, they do not seek to influence the vortex, and therefore do not engage in the race for control of it. Instead, they seek the nine cursed Books of Nagash, a search culminating in an epic battle at the Black Pyramid of Nagash itself. Each of these books grants a unique campaign bonus, and puts the player a step further along the road to victory.Unique resource: Canopic JarsAncient containers filled with arcane energy, Canopic Jars can be collected through missions, buildings, and as post-battle loot. They are used to awaken powerful units, unlock techs, perform rites and to craft unique items in the Mortuary Cult. The Mortuary CultKeepers of the Lore of Nehekhara and the secrets of revivification, the Liche Priests of the Mortuary Cult can be called upon to construct unique and venerable items. Using a combination of trade resources and Canopic Jars, the player can order the construction of unique magic weapons, armour, talismans, plus enchanted and arcane items. For a cost, the Mortuary Cult can also resurrect powerful Legions of Legend for use in your armies. The Dynasties of NehekharaRather than developing new technologies, the Tomb Kings seek to unearth the achievements of their dynastic forbears. By studying these histories, players can resurrect great rulers of the past to serve as Lords for their armies, increase capacity for the various Tomb Kings Heroes, unlock a host of campaign and unit buffs, and awaken the Heralds of ancient armies – unique followers who bring powerful bonuses to key unit types in an army. RitesThe Tomb Kings have four unique Rites which may be unlocked and used in campaign:Great Incantation of PtraInvoking the sun god summons Ptra’s Necrotect, a unique Hero character capable of colonising ruins at city level 3.Great Incantation of KhsarInvoking the god of the desert wind generates sandstorms across all player-owned regions. This causes attrition to foreign armies, increases your ambush success chance and confers the army ability Sand Veil (enables a unit to become Hidden and gain Stalk in battle, making them invisible to the enemy until they draw very close).Great Incantation of GehebInvoking the god of strength increases Canopic Jar generation and province growth, reduces construction time, and confers the army ability Tombswarm (a swirling swarm of Scarabs which damages the target and moves in the same manner as a vortex spell).Great Incantation of TahothInvoking the god of scholars adds a Casket of Souls magical artillery unit to the recruitment pool. It also confers a rank bonus to newly recruited Tomb Kings and unit recruits, and increases recruitment capacity factionwide.Legendary LordsThe Tomb Kings feature four playable Legendary Lords, each with their own abilities, campaign bonuses, skill trees, quest-chains and campaign start-positions in both the Eye of the Vortex campaign and Mortal Empires.Settra The ImperishableSettra is the king of all Tomb Kings. He is a ruthless leader whose thirst for conquest knows no bounds. Unlike other Tomb Kings, his unyielding will is such that he never needs to return to his sarcophagus to rest. The immortality he so desired in life is now his, and the civilisations that flourished in his absence now feel his wrath. Settra is a great leader, bringing bonuses to growth and public order, while reducing construction time. He also confers bonus armour to Skeleton Chariot and Tomb Guard units, and has a selection of unlockable mounts, including the Khemrian Warsphinx and the flame-wreathed Chariot of the Gods.High Queen KhalidaThe Warrior-Queen of Lybaras was famed for her intelligence, honour and bravery. Her reign was cut tragically short by her cousin Neferata, who had attempted to create the Elixir of Life. Instead of true immortality though, Neferata’s flawed potion granted the twisted form known as Vampirism, and as the first Vampire slew her cousin in combat, she granted her the Blood Kiss. With her last breath, Khalida cried out to Asaph, the serpent goddess, who purified her of the taint. She is now the Goddess’ chosen, with Asaph’s divine venom coursing through her veins.Khalida reduces all forms of corruption, enjoys a diplomatic relations bonus with other Tomb Kings factions and grants a hefty bonus to ammunition for all ranged units across her faction. She also confers poison attacks on all units in her army and suffers considerably less from attrition effects. Grand Hierophant KhatepThe head of the Mortuary Cult’s Hieorphantic Council, Khatep is the oldest and wisest of the Liche Priests, and the first of them to deny death’s embrace. It was Khatep who awoke Settra to unlife after Nagash’s Great Ritual levelled Nehekhara, but Settra’s distrust of the Mortuary Cult led him to exile Khatep. Now he roams the Land of the Dead, assisting the Tomb Kings where he can and seeking a way to restore himself in the eyes of Settra.Khatep grants a bonus to Dynasty research rate, and improves casualty replenishment and army movement factionwide. He can also recruit a higher number of Liche Priest Heroes, and recruits them at a higher rank. Arkhan the BlackNagash’s principle lieutenant, Arkhan helped lead the coup which brought the hated arch-necromancer to initial power. He led many armies against Nagash’s enemies, and was finally slain in a suicidal counter-attack against the Priest King’s soldiers that enabled Nagash to escape. He was raised again by his master to become the Liche King, and for countless generations since Nagash’s death at the hands of King Alcadizaar, he has vented his wrath on the lands of the living.   Arkhan enjoys bonus diplomatic relations with Vampire Counts factions, and his regions never suffer public order penalties from Vampiric corruption. Heroes embedded in his army gain melee attack and melee defence bonuses, and all his armies factionwide gain a boost to their Winds of Magic Power Reserve. New Lord: Tomb KingTomb Kings are the principle Lords which lead the armies of Nehekhara. A number will appear as standard in the recruitment pool, but unique, named Tomb Kings – famous rulers from the six dynasties of Nehekharan history – may be resurrected via the Dynasties panel, at which point they enter your Lords recruitment pool. Tomb kings may unlock the Skeletal Steed, Skeleton Chariot, and Khemrian Warsphinx as mounts.New Hero: Tomb PrinceFollowing the example of their kings, Tomb Princes aspire to greatness in all things. They form the principle champions of the Nehekharan forces in battle, and have a unique Curse ability which makes targeted enemies enter a state of Rampage. Tomb princes may unlock Skeletal Steeds and Skeletal Chariots as mounts.New Hero: Liche PriestThe adepts of the Mortuary Cult are the Tomb King’s principle sorcerers. They may be recruited to wield the Lore of Light, the Lore of Death, or the Lore of Nehekhara, and have a unique Curse ability which reduces enemy armour values. They also gain the Immortal skill earlier than other agents. Liche priests may unlock Skeletal Steeds and Skeleton Chariots as mounts.New Hero: NecrotectRepresenting millennia of architectural wisdom, Necrotects are the builders and taskmasters of Nehekhara. They perform a number of functions, such as reducing building costs and increasing movement speed when embedded in your armies, but also fulfil a key support role in battle. As master masons, they provide passive aura-based buffs to Construct units such as Ushabti, Tomb Scorpions and Hierotitans, improving their combat abilities in a number of ways. Necrotects may unlock Skeletal Steeds and Skeleton Chariots as mounts.Battle gameplayThe Realm of Souls The Realm of Souls is the revered afterlife of Nehekharan legend, and the origin of the Liche Priests’ magical power. As more of your warriors fall to the enemy in battle, more souls enter the Realm, which is tracked in the battle UI. At three key thresholds, the Realm of Souls triggers a mass healing-wave among your skeletal units, each wave becoming successively more powerful. After the final wave, the player also gains an army ability allowing them to summon a unit of statuesque Ushabti anywhere on the battlefield.  The Lore of NehekharaIn battle, Liche Priests may harness the power of the desert gods and wield the Tomb King’s signature magic, the Lore of Nehekhara.',\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"About This ContentThe Warden & the Paunch is the latest Lords Pack for Total War: WARHAMMER II. Introducing two rival Legendary Lords from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, each with their own factions, objectives, mechanics, units and playstyle, for use in both the Eye of the Vortex and Mortal Empires campaigns, and custom/multiplayer battles.  Eltharion the Grim commands Yvresse (High Elves) while Grom the Paunch leads the Broken Axe Tribe (Greenskins). Neither Yvresse nor the Broken Axe tribe are involved in the Vortex race, but are pitted against one another as eternal nemeses, on a collision course to a final climactic encounter where only one can emerge the victor. Long has Eltharion the Warden of Tor Yvresse stood sentinel, ever-watchful for signs of Greenskin incursion. While he campaigned overseas against the Druchii of Naggarond in ages past, Tor Yvresse nearly fell as the green tsunami of Grom the Paunch’s legendary Waaagh! roared through Ulthuan. After defeating Grom and scattering his hordes, Eltharion swore that no Orc or Goblin filth would ever set foot in his lands again.  But Grom has other designs. His cavernous belly aches for a rematch, and his hunger for vengeance is matched only by his titanic appetite. As his gobbos tend to the bubbling cauldron, delighting him with each tasty new morsel, his plans begin to set. He’ll gather them all, the bosses and the boys, wind them up to a fever pitch, and lead them on a Waaagh! the likes of which the world has never seen. This time, Tor Yvresse will fall, and its snooty Warden will kneel before the mighty Paunch!  High Elves - Eltharion the Grim (Yvresse) Unique faction mechanics:  Athel TamarhaIn a secluded Yvresse mountainside lies Athel Tamarha, Eltharion’s base of operations. It lies in ruins, untouched since Grom’s previous Waaagh!, but Eltharion seeks to rebuild it in Tor Yvresse’s defence. In Eltharion's campaign, Athel Tamarha is represented by a new panel where the player rebuilds structures to gain numerous unique benefits. In addition, Eltharion can use his unique Warden’s Cage ability against enemy Heroes and Lords in battle. Should they fall while under its influence, they will be imprisoned in Athel Tamarha for interrogation… Athel Tamarha has a number of  structures across two unique chains which can be rebuilt. Each enhances Tor Yvresse’s defence rating and grants the following: The Silent Sentinels chain can increase Tor Yvresse’s defence rating and enable the recruitment and upgrading of elite Mistwalker units, plus increasing recruitment capacities for several unique elite unit types available to Eltharion.  The Watchers of Yvresse chain enable the interrogation of captured Heroes and Lords, improvements to the Mist of Yvresse, and bonuses to Eltharion’s Influence. Through the questioning, vanquishing and indoctrination of captives, Eltharion can gain useful information and other benefits.   Mist of Yvresse Tor Yvresse will become progressively shrouded by an enchanted mist, enhancing all of Eltharion's troops and disrupting enemies caught within it.\\u202f Provides the unique Army Ability ‘Envelop in Mist’ which enhances your troops’ performance when fighting within its influence Athel Tamarha upgrades grant additional effects as the Mist become stronger. Increasing the strength of the Mist of Yvresse will eventually cause it to cover all of Ulthuan as a protective aid.  Defence of Yvresse Eltharion will gradually build up defensive power at Tor Yvresse, as Eltharion's homeland becomes increasingly fortified against invasion. At the campaign outset, the city of Tor Yvresse will begin in a damaged state until upgrades are completed, progressing the city into rebuilt then fortified states. This is reflected in any battles fought over Tor Yvresse, affording increasingly stronger defensive abilities and options for Eltharion.\\u202f The Yvresse defence level also expands the Mist of Yvresse to cover further regions of Ulthuan, enhancing Eltharion’s forces and weakening interlopers.\\u202f \\u202f  Rite:\\u202fInvocation of Ladrielle For Eltharion, the Invocation of Isha is replaced by the Invocation of Ladrielle, which empowers the Mists of Yvresse.New Units and Characters: Eltharion (Legendary\\u202fLord)Eltharion the Grim is the unflinching warden of Tor Yvresse. Atop his mighty Griffon, Stormwing, he swoops into battle with peerless conviction.  Eltharion wields a spear and a sword, as well as being a caster of High Magic. This offers him the flexibility to alter his role in battle based on the circumstances at hand. His defence-focused abilities also make him excellent at holding firm battle lines.  Archmage (Lord)The High Elven Archmages are amongst the greatest practitioners of Magic within the mortal realms. With the introduction of the Archmage, High Elf players now have access to all 8 core Winds of Magic and the Lore of High Magic to choose from, ideal for those who prefer a more magic-focused playstyle. RangersHigh Elf Rangers are inhabitants of Ulthuan's more remote areas and are called upon in times of need.  Silverin GuardHeavy Spear unit for High Elves.\\u202fThe Silverin Guard are tasked with defending the Watchstone of Tor Yvresse - a waystone of fabulous power.  War Lions of ChraceThese fearsome beasts are deadly hunting cats with a muscular frame and a sharp, cunning mind. Almost as tall at the shoulders as an Elven Steed, a War Lion is far stronger, able to break bones with each sweep of its claws and shatter even helmeted heads with a single chomp of its fanged maw.  Lion Chariot of Chrace Many of the Phoenix King's bodyguard ride to battle in Lion Chariots. Each of these white-timbered constructions is drawn by a pair of snarling War Lions whose savage power is belied by their feline grace and elegantly plaited manes. Arcane Phoenix The Arcane Phoenix is a majestic and fearsome creature with a wingspan as great as any of the mighty War Eagles of the High Elves. Cloaked in blazing feathers that can turn the sharpest arrow, it is the living embodiment of the destructive and purging Wind of Aqshy.  Campaign Exclusive Units: Eltharion's Mistwalkers The Skyhawks Swift and energetic, the Skyhawks never weary of battle, always standing ready to fight to the death if necessary.  Sentinels of Astaril Former training partners to the Warden himself in his youth, the Sentinels are amongst his most trusted servicemen.  Spire Guard of Tor Yvresse The honour guards of the Warden’s tower are Tor Yvresse’s foremost defenders, and the anchor around which its armies gather.  Athel Tamarha Faithbearers Once of the household of Eltharion’s late father, the Faithbearers’ guilt over their master’s death drives them to fight to reclaim their valour.  Knights of Tor Gaval Thanks to the challenges of training in their murky homeland, the Knights of Tor Gaval are rightly said to be amongst the most talented of wingmen in all Ulthuan.  New Regiments of\\u202fRenown Talons of Tor Caleda (Archers Light Armour) The Talons of Tor Caleda are an elite unit for Archers who serve the Prince of Caledor.  Rahagra's Pride (War Lions of Chrace) Rahagra's Pride inherit their name from the fabled father of white lions.  Omen of Asuryan (Arcane Phoenix) Arcane Phoenixes are the companions of Asuryan the Creator, harbingers of woe and bearers of hope in equal measure. They are drawn from Asuryan's side when the Winds of Magic howl through the world of mortals in mighty storms, and in distant mist-shrouded Ulthuan the High Elves are forewarned of the coming of these magical tempests by the sudden manifestation of Arcane Phoenixes in the skies above their island home. They are a mixed omen; a symbol of destruction soon to come as well as the hope of rebirth. Greenskins - Grom the Paunch (Broken Axe) Unique mechanics and features:  Grom's Cauldron Grom has an insatiable appetite, as his girth attests to. In a Grom campaign, you’ll find a variety of ingredients around the world with which to cook up a range of recipes. By combining different\\u202fingredients in Grom's Cauldron, Grom and his boyz will be able to feast and gain special powers. Unlock a wide range of different ingredients from campaign exploration, and by meeting the Troll Hag Food Merchant. Combine ingredients to form dishes, each of which provides unique buffs to Grom and his army Some dishes can add special units to Grom's army Cooking up and sampling a certain number of dishes will permanently enhance Grom himself.  Blacktoof During Grom’s legendary Waaagh!, his most trusted Shaman, Ol’ Blacktoof, nearly brought destruction to Ulthuan and beyond by felling the Elven Waystones and drawing their power into himself. Fate intervened in the form of Eltharion, who separated Blacktoof’s head neatly from his shoulders. But the shaman’s surging power helped him to cheat true death, and his disembodied head serves his master still.  While Niblet is Grom’s chief advisor, Blacktoof will from time to time utter guidance to Grom, delivering tasks and moulding the journey to his inevitable and decisive showdown with Eltharion. Blacktoof’s head will also take on the role of a special item in Grom's campaign. He may be assigned to a Shaman, granting the ability to summon a Rogue Idol in battle. New Units and Characters: Grom the Paunch (Legendary Lord) Grom is the self-styled king of the goblins. He wields the mighty Axe of Grom, and rides into battle atop the sturdy Chariot of Grom, with his trusty Night Goblin Assistant and standard bearer, Niblet.  The presence of Grom near friendly troops inspires them with a leadership buff. If Grom makes his way into the fighting, that buff increases. Grom is ALWAYS mounted atop the Chariot of Grom.  Giant River Hag Troll (Hero) Giant River Troll Hags are hateful and bitter creatures, far larger and more dangerous than their common kin. These Lore of Death casters are invested with an innate ability to shape the Winds of Magic as they stir the brackish waters in which they dwell.  Snotling Pump Wagons The Snotling Pump Wagon is a wooden fighting platform on wheels. Like a chariot, a Pump Wagon hurtles towards the foe to run them over. However, the Pump Wagon rumbles under its own power, with momentum provided by Snotlings, who frantically pump crude contraptions and cranks to drive the belts that turn the wheels.  Snotling Pump Wagons (Flappas) Flappas are crude wings, attached to the side of the Pump Wagon, and flapped up and down by the actions of the crew. This allows the Pump Wagon to make short jumps as it bounces along.  Snotling Pump Wagons (Spiky Rollers) These Pump Wagons are fitted with a roller studded with sharp spikes.  River Trolls A River Troll somewhat resembles a riverbed: coated in sediment, slime, rotting vegetation, fish carcasses, and various other stinky detritus whose precise nature and origin are too horrible to contemplate. In all probability the River Troll’s stink is even worse than that of the riverbed, since one can add the Troll’s personal miasma to the ill-omened mélange of odours emitted from the mucky smears on its skin.  Stone Trolls Stone Trolls are a distinct breed of Troll which live exclusively in caves and the mountainous regions of the world. Since they live on rocky mountains, they tend to consume large quantities of stone, the natural magical inertia of which imbues them with a certain degree of magical resistance.  Rogue Idol Rogue Idols are mighty magical constructs with the ability to crush armoured knights, batter city walls and just about anything else that gets in their way with their brutal fists.  New Regiments of Renown Logey Bogey's Spore 'Sploda's (Snotling Pump Wagon) The most unhinged Snotlings attach really big explodin' spores to the front of their Wagons, which burst when the Pump Wagon hits anything.  Da Swamp Fings (River Trolls) Da Swamp 'Fings are a horrifying band of River Trolls which cause Terror and have Poison Attacks.  Da Big 'Un (Rogue Idol) Da Big 'Un is the biggest, baddest, meanest, most cunning Rogue Idol ever conjured.

       "  'full_bio': 'X4: Foundations is the latest title in the popular X series of space simulation / sandbox games, played as action games from a first-person perspective in a living breathing universe, with TRADE FIGHT BUILD THINK as the common tag-line. X4: Foundations is unique in its depth, simulating an entire universe of NPC ships and stations, forming a realistic economy. It consists of a huge universe, simulated from the bottom up. Hundreds of stations, and thousands of ships, trade goods among themselves. Prices change based on supply and demand; resources are mined and processed in several stages. This economy is linked directly to the simulation of major conflicts in a universe with dynamically-acting factions. Every player decision can dramatically change the future of the game universe. Step in and live your very own space adventure!X4: Foundations has been significantly enlarged with its 3.0 Update – this is the perfect time for space game enthusiasts to newly discover or revisit the biggest space sandbox this side of the galaxy! Jump into your ship and experience the brand-new storyline \"A lever to move the world\", introducing diplomatic missions. Become the best pilot out there with our new flight school.Start your journeyIn X4, you can start your journey from a number of different gamestarts and as a number of different characters, each with their own role, set of relationships and different ships and technologies to start with. No matter how you start, you are always free to develop in any other direction. Focus on exploration, make money with illegal trading and theft, command large battle fleets or become the greatest entrepreneur ever. It\\'s all up to you to decide.Fly every shipX4 allows you to fly all ships personally. From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrier, everything can be piloted from the cockpit or an external view. A big focus in the development of X4 has been to achieve a seamless and immersive experience when moving between ships. You can leave a ship, climb down a ladder, walk over the dock of a large space station into another ship you may have parked there and replace the pilot that was working for you just by clicking on his chair.Build space stations and upgrade your shipsBuilding space stations and factories has always been a foundation of the X games. After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to establish their own economy and start influencing the universe on a larger scale. In X4, it is now possible to be completely free and creative. Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The powerful new map system allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations. Ships also offer a variety of upgrades. Engines, weapons and other equipment can be added in a graphical editor and actually seen on the ship.Experience the most dynamic X universe ever X4 is the first X game to allow our races and factions to freely build and expand their empires; the same flexibility the player enjoys in creatively designing space stations from modular building blocks is also available to them. Races expand their empire based on supply and demand, which leads to an extremely dynamic universe where every action the player makes can influence the course of the entire universe.Manage your empire with a powerful mapOnce you have more ships and many NPCs working for you as pilots, crew or station managers, the map will be your preferred method of managing it all. Ships can be ordered with simple clicks and through drag-and-drop operations to set their future path and commands. Graphically plan your trade routes, coordinate attacks with your entire fleet, manage the hierarchy or send ships on remote exploration missions.Dive into the most detailed X economy everOne of the key selling points of X games has always been the realistic, simulated economy. Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game, all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources. Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy.Research and teleportThe seamless change from ship to ship and from NPCs controlling your empire for you continues on a higher level. Once you own a larger fleet, you will be very interested in researching a technology from your HQ: Teleportation. Once you\\'ve unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand. Every order you have given to a ship before turns into a mission objective when you pilot the ship yourself. The moment you leave again, your pilot takes the helm and continues with their previous orders.',\n",

Be it powerful armoured combat vehicles, unstoppable resource gathering machines, sprawling resource processing bases or a hybrid of all three - creativity is your key to exo-planetary success.The worlds in TerraTech are procedurally generated and infinite, so there are always new lands to discover and more resources to find. Treacherous mountain ranges, luscious grasslands and huge deserts are among the biomes you will encounter. More will be added as development progresses.The intergalactic mining industry is a profitable one, but you are not the only miner in search for new worlds to exploit. Defending yourself from rival miners will take time, resources and skill, with success leading to new territory and new lands. All equipable blocks and items can be damaged or destroyed, so ensuring you are sufficiently armed and ready for battle is a key element of both survival and prosperity in TerraTech.

Go prospecting for the needed resources, and craft a couple for yourself in the shiny new Venture fabricator which you just aquired, by beating their time trial challenge in the nearby mountains.All exo-planetary prospectors buy parts from the established Mining Corporations, where each have their own specific brand of mining technology. Get the job done with GSO, strip-mine to the max with the heavy-duty GeoCorp, zoom around with high-performance recon specialists Venture, function with military efficiency utilising the stealth focused Hawkeye or gain technological superiority with Enviro-giants Better Future. New Corporations we’re aiming to add to the game include deranged experimental scientists Reticule Research, and the hive-mind AI swarms of LEGION.

You will most likely experience balancing issues, performance issues, bugs and missing features. If you are looking for a complete gaming experience, I would recommend allowing some time before trying out the game. There are many YouTube game-plays showing the current state of game. I am the sole developer of the project, which I work on as a passion project. I feel this is important to mention, so that those considering playing the game can make a more informed purchase decision. A full detailed list of the updates since launch can be viewed here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/418030/allnews/.Goals of the project:The aim is to integrate the kinds of base-resource micro-management typically found in RTS titles, into a boots-on-the-ground shooter. Each base has an underlying economy of power and raw materials that must be maintained and expanded in order to rise in dominance. The focus is not of primitive survival (although there are many elements during the early-game), but instead a focus on the base, its security, technology and resources.',\n",

You’ll get to meet Michael Myers himself. Together with Laurie Strode, you’ll either fight for survival or slaughter in their old hometown, Haddonfield.The masks we wear...A white mask that stalks the night. A simple babysitter who wouldn’t hurt a fly, a town that felt safe as they went to sleep with unlocked doors. Whatever happened that dark Halloween Night?HALLOWEEN® is a Chapter for Dead by Daylight and it includes a new Killer, a Survivor and a Map.A familiar faceWe all hide behind masks. Some more than others, and for Michael Myers, this is more true than ever. If there is any humanity left inside him, it is hidden behind his mask. All his screaming victims see are lifeless eyes as he robs them of their lives.Obsessive behaviourMichael Myers is a disturbed being with a mind only focused one thing, killing. He is beyond help, and the only thing that can sooth his mind - for a while - is to kill. His power is called EVIL WITHIN, and as he stalks his prey, he starts to obsess, thus tagging a Survivor as an Obsession. This in turn, changes the chances of survival radically.Michael Myers also comes with 3 new Perks, all based around Obsession.Save the best for last – As Obsessions stays alive, cooldown of missed and successful attacks are decreased.Dying Light – The Obsession’s’ speed for altruistic actions - such as healing and rescuing - is increased. But once killed, there’s a penalty to repairing, healing and sabotage for other Survivors.Play with your food – As you let your Obsession escape after a chase, your movement speed is increased.The babysitterLaurie Strode’s suburban way of life was simple, even boring from time to time. Sunday night dinners. Game shows on TV. She filled her days with school, earning a few bucks babysitting the neighbor's kids and seeing friends. Her life and name would never had made the headlines or earned it’s spot in the town’s history, if it weren’t for that one fateful night.\\u2003Escape - again and again.Laurie has done this before. Escaping and surviving, over and over again. Her perks are focused around becoming the Killer’s Obsessions. Laurie is a survivor by heart and will never give up.Laurie Strode comes with 3 new Perks, emphasizing on Obsession and survival.Last Survivor – Your chances of survival increases as other Survivors die - disrupting the Killer’s aura reading ability.Decisive Strike – As a last way of escaping the Killer’s grasp, Laurie takes a stab at the Killer.Object of Obsession – If you’re the Killer’s Obsession, you are able to see the Killer’s own aura. You are now entering HaddonfieldNobody would ever suspect that a place like Haddonfield could shape the terror that is Michael Myers. It’s a calm place, a secluded place, a place where you can take a midnight stroll with your dog and never think twice about what’s hiding in the dark.But that Haddonfield is no more. Instead a new place has formed after the events. A place where people make sure that their door is locked. A place where you might see a neighbor, just gazing out in the dark, as they thought they saw someone…Welcome home, Laurie!Haddonfield is a brand new map for DEAD BY DAYLIGHT.Echoes of children’s laughter and carolers can still be heard as you enter Haddonfield. Houses, streets, rusty bikes and driveways fuse together with the dark night and create a realm of fear and horror. But don’t be fooled by the town’s calm facade. Instead, be alert and aware of Haddonfield’s dark past. As you’re now part of it.\",\n",

The Doctor will see you now, whether you want to or not. The only glimpse of hope is a young girl, one who never gives up and always finds a way.Treatment in progress...Information is power.Everything is allowed.Intelligence is a weapon that must be thwarted.This doctor will never stop, treatments will never be too experimental.A young girl who is in it to win, no matter what the game or the rules. A research institution that slowly turns into a prison.The Spark of Madness Chapter includes a new Killer, a Survivor and a Map.Herman “The Doctor” CarterCarter had good intentions, at first. He set out to understand the human psyche. But wars and secrecy disrupted his good intentions, and instead Carter started to experiment with more and more unwilling test subjects that entered were brought to him. Instead of understanding, he sought means of controlling. By any means necessary. Sometimes words and texts are as useful as bonesaws and electricity.Carter’s SparkIs it a gift  or a curse? The Entity has ignited a corrupted and inexhaustible spark in the Doctor’s heart which allows him to generate electroconvulsive power at will. His vicious treatment corrupts the minds of those it touches. Victims shocked by the spark begin to lose their grip on reality and, with repeated exposure, inevitably succumb to madness.The Doctor comes with 3 new perks.OVERWHELMING PRESENCEYour presence alone instills great fear. Survivors within your terror radius suffer from inefficiency.Survivors’ item consumption rates are increased.MONITOR & ABUSEMeticulous in your approach, terrifying in your application.While in a chase, your terror radius is increased. Otherwise your terror radius is decreased and your field of view is increased.Field of view gains do not stack.OVERCHARGEYou are fuelled by your hate for progress.Overcharge a generator by performing the Break Generator action. The next survivor interacting with that generator is faced with a difficult Skill-check. Failing the Skill-check results in an additional generator regression. Succeeding the Skill-check grants no progress but prevents the generator explosion.Press StartFeng found the light in computer games early on. And she wouldn’t let go. It became her life. And a goal for her to reach. She started out with low level competitions held at internet cafés. Striving to climb the ladder. The only thing that got in her way was her lone wolf attitude. A solitary life in front of a screen fitted her perfectly. But teams...is something completely different. But what proved to be a downside in the world of the living, might just save her life in another.Feng Min comes with 3 new Perks.TECHNICIANYou are apt at handling machinery with the greatest care and precision.The noises caused by your repairs and their hearing distance are reduced. On a failed repair Skill-check, there is a chance the generator’s explosion will be prevented.ALERTYour acute senses are on high alert.When the Killer performs the break action within range, the killer is revealed to you.LITHEAfter performing a vault, break into a sprint. Activates in chases only.Causes Exhaustion.Lithe cannot be used while Exhausted.Checking in...A research facility should be a place where minds grow, where learning happens. But the Léry Memorial Institute is quite the opposite. It’s a place where the human brain is turned into something unpleasant and broken.. Electricity is the everywhere and dirty tools are found laying around. The facility is a place where all methods are acceptable - as long as information is retrieved. Whether the “subject” is alive after the procedure is not important.Nowadays the facility is  abandoned but the methods are not. Snow and rust have replaced the screams and tears. A few marks on the walls and the furniture, some books… Nothing else remembers all those who lost their minds and their lives in there.',\n",

       "  'full_bio': 'About This ContentOur Hornet is the culmination of more than 40 man years of intense research, technology development, art creation, and ground-breaking coding. The Hornet brings the first, true, multi-role fighter to the skies of DCS World with equally impressive air-to-surface and air-to-air capabilities. DCS: F/A-18C Hornet is initially being released as an Open Beta, with several features to be added during the Open Beta period. This includes several sensors, weapons, and sub-systems.About the DCS: F/A-18C HornetThe F/A-18C Hornet is twin engine, supersonic fighter that is flown by a single pilot in a “glass cockpit”. It combines extreme maneuverability , a deadly arsenal of weapons, and the ability to operate from an aircraft carrier. Operated by several nations, this multi-role fighter has been instrumental in conflicts from 1986 to today.The Hornet is equipped with a large suite of sensors that includes a radar, targeting pod, and a helmet mounted sight. In addition to its internal 20mm cannon, the Hornet can be armed with a large assortment of unguided bombs and rockets, laser and GPS-guided bombs, air-to-surface missiles of all sorts, and both radar and infrared-guided air-to-air missiles. This results in amazing gameplay potential with this single aircraft.The Hornet is also known for its extreme, slow-speed maneuverability in a dogfight. We have gone to great lengths to model the flight aerodynamics and fly-by-wire flight control system of the Hornet to allow you to experience the real feeling of power and extreme capabilities this aircraft has to offer. Although incredibly deadly, the Hornet is also a very easy aircraft to fly.Being an aircraft carrier capable aircraft, our Hornet also comes with the most detailed aircraft carrier ever created for a PC game. Catapult from the “boat”, strike a large assortment of targets that only DCS World can offer, then “call the ball” and land on the carrier. DCS: F/A-18C Hornet in DCS World provides the most rich and authentic digital combat aviation you will ever experience!Key Features of DCS: F/A-18C Hornet: Professional Flight Model (PFM) and authentic Flight Control System (FCS). Experience the thrill of flying this supersonic warbird.Includes a new, highly-detailed USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier with fully operational steam catapults, arrestor wires, “meat ball” landing system, TACAN navigation, jet blast deflectors, radar antennas, defense systems, and lights.The most realistic model of the F/A-18C imaginable, down to each bolt and flake of paint, animated controls surfaces, lights, damage model, and landing gear.Detailed simulation of the Hornet’s many sub-systems like engines, fuel, electrical, hydraulic, radios, lighting, emergency, and many, many more. Although features like “auto start” are available, the sense of accomplishment cannot be overstated after learning to operate this state-of-the-art machine.Inertia and GPS navigation systems with moving map display allow you multiple ways to find your target and get you back to “mother”.Dozens of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons and sensors. From simple rockets to high-tech GPS and laser-guided bombs, experience what only Hornet pilots have experienced ‘til now.A highly realistic and exhaustively researched cockpit that is mouse interactive with 6 degrees of freedom. Interact with the cockpit by pressing buttons and moving switches. You will feel like part of the aircraft with our Advanced Systems Modeling (ASM) .Authentic Hornet sounds provided with the assistance of Boeing, the Hornet’s manufacturer. New effects have been developed for our Hornet like leading edge extension vapor, over-wing vapor, rain on canopy, and new explosions.Virtual Reality support. Take advantage of the latest VR technologies to immerse yourself in the simulation. Other than the G’s, you will feel like you are there!Multiple liveries for the US Navy, US Marine Corps, Canada, Australia, Spain, Switzerland, Finland, and many more.Open Beta ReleaseThis is an Open Beta release and the following items will be added during the Open Beta development period:Sensors:A/A radar with TWS, SCAN RAID, AZ/ELA/G radar with MAP, EXP1, EXP2, EXP3, SEA, GMT, PVU, AGR, IRA, and TAAN/ASQ-228 ATFLIR Targeting PodJoint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS)Link-16AWW-13 Datalink PodNVGsWeapons:AGM-88C HARMAGM-45A/B ShrikeAGM-84D Block 1C HarpoonAGM-84E SLAMAGM-84H/K SLAM-ERAGM-65E/F/G MaverickAGM-154A/C JSOWWalleye I/II ER/DLGBU-10/12/16/24B Paveway IIGBU-38/31/32 JDAMAIM-9X SidewinderAIM-7P SparrowAIM-120B/C AMRAAMMk-40 Destructor Sea MineMk-63 Quickstrike Sea MineMk-77 Fire BombDecoys:ADM-141 TALDGEN-X',\n",

Almost infinite options give the player all the creative freedom to create unique cars with vastly different engines. Automation also features an in-game exporter which allows you to export and drive your vehicles in BeamNG.drive. The exporter is simple to use: design your car and engine in Automation, tune them to your liking, hit the export button, start up BeamNG.drive and your new car is right there in the vehicle list, with the aesthetics as well as many of the fine engineering and performance details of your car design simulated accuratelyKEY PLANNED FEATURES FOR THE COMPLETED GAME: Extremely Deep, Technical, Creative – Experience unheard-of creative freedom in a highly technical, realistic gameplay experience revolving around building a car company from scratch.

       "  'full_bio': \"About This ContentNight falls on Lustria. As you stand on the dock and peer seawards through the gathering mists, strain your ears. The jungle sounds behind you fade, and in their place comes a wet thudding, as of rotten rigging against a mouldy mast. The sound multiplies, and with it, the groan of a thousand breathless voices, joined in something part-shanty, part-dirge. Dread prows pierce the gloom ahead, and the ghastly truth is laid bare: upon the ghoul-winds come the swollen hulks and decaying vessels of the Vampire Coast! Run now – run hard and fast. For it is all you can do.It was the undying lord Luthor Harkon that laid claim to a stretch of Lustria’s east coast. Ever since, it has been a domain where the dead stir, leading expeditions into the jungle interior or setting sail across the Great Ocean to commit wanton acts of piracy. But the insane Arch-Commodore Harkon is not the only unliving admiral who takes to the seas with pistol-armed crews of zombies, vampiric depth guard, syreens and mournguls… there are other pirate lords who command dreadfleets of their own, packed to the gunwales with crews press-ganged into eternal service. These tyrants ply the seas seeking plunder of blood and gold. However, now that the vortex of Ulthuan weakens, the captains search for more than mere treasure… for the Star-Metal Harpoon lies in the deeps, a weapon powerful enough to bring the greatest Merwyrm of them all to heel!Campaign Pack Contains:4 new Legendary Lords New School of Magic: The Lore of the Deep A suite of all-new campaign mechanicsUnique upgradeable ships for each Legendary LordEight new Regiments of Renown Unique tech tree unlocking four unique Vampire Coast LordsReward your undead Admirals with new Fleet Office Roles befitting their loyaltyNew roster: command towering constructs, ghastly pincered sea-beasts, ghoulish horrors and musket-wielding piratical zombie hordes in battle! Vampire Coast factions are playable in the Eye of the Vortex and Mortal Empires campaigns. They are not involved with the race for the Great Vortex however; they have agendas of their own…New Campaign Features and Mechanics:ObjectivesThe great Merwyrm Amanar has been awoken from its slumber by the vacillations of the Great Vortex. It terrorizes the sea lanes, summoning vast storms and attacking coastal ports on a whim. Only one who wields the Star-Metal Harpoon will tame the beast and become immune to its ravenous hungers. However, the Harpoon must first be found, and invigorated using the three verses of a secret, ancient sea-shanty.Each playable Legendary Lord must grow their dread reputation to become the most Infamous pirate on the seas. Certain opposing Pirate Captains know the three verses of the ancient shanty and, as your Infamy rivals theirs, they will seek you out in attempt to destroy you. If you best each in battle, you’ll learn each of these verses, all three of which are required to magically charge the Star-Metal Harpoon.Only with the fully-powered Star-Metal Harpoon in hand can you embark on the final, fateful battle, bend Amanar to your will, and become the greatest sea-scourge the world has ever seen!InfamyAs your faction wins battles, takes territory and establishes Pirate Coves (see Pirate Coves below), Your Legendary Lord’s Infamy grows amongst the ranks of pirate lords and ladies. This is the route by which you reach ultimate victory in a Vampire Coast campaign (please see Objectives above). Pirate CovesAfter a victorious port-settlement battle, Vampire Coast factions may choose a new post-battle option. Instead of taking, sacking or razing the port, the faction may choose to establish a Pirate Cove in the vicinity. These secret sub-settlements can siphon a steady flow of income from the main settlement, and bring other benefits related to any upgrades the player chooses to build in the Cove. The Cove can only be destroyed if the settlement itself is razed. In addition, a competing Vampire Coast faction which conquers the settlement may commandeer the Cove for itself. Upgradeable Ships and Building TreesLegendary Lords sail in their own unique ships. Details of these ship are accessed via the Lord in the same fashion as Horde Buildings for Horde Factions, and contain many powerful upgrades for the Lord and his army. This does not make them a standard Horde faction however. Vampire Coast lords may also occupy settlement like any other non-horde faction, and may develop it using the unique new Vampire Coast building tree. In short, they benefit from the best features of both Horde factions and Settled factions.Pieces of Eight!Carefully hidden around the world are eight unique golden tokens. Locating each and defeating its powerful guardian army will grant access to the Vampire Coast Regiments of Renown, powerful elite variants of units in the terrifying Vampire Coast roster.Treasure MapsPirates of folklore buried great treasures around the world. As you win battles at land and sea, you may find the treasure maps marking their rough location. Solve the riddles that shroud them, and they can be yours for the taking... Unique RitesVampire Coast factions gain access to four unique new Rites, granting a variety of bonuses. Curse of the Queen’s Cannon, for example, grants access to Queen Bess, a vast, one-off ship’s cannon which fires colossal cannonballs in a high parabolic arc, dealing tremendous area-effect damage and slowing those affected by the shockwave. Another, Curse of the Sea Mist, shrouds all your regions with a clinging maritime miasma, causing attrition to your enemies and granting Vanguard Deployment to your Monster units.New battlefieldsNew Island Maps Broaden Total War: WARHAMMER II’s battlefield environments and, for the first time, players may now attack and defend Dark Elf Black Arks in battle, fighting with their assembled land forces on the lofty slopes of these vast seagoing structures. These new maps will be available to all WARHAMMER II players, regardless of Curse of the Vampire Coast ownership.Legendary LordsDetailed information on the Legendary Lords of the Vampire Coast are available to dive into on the official Total War Academy pages: https://academy.totalwar.com/vampire-coast/Luthor HarkonFor centuries, Arch Grand Commodore Luthor Harkon has ruled a stretch of Lustrian shore known as the Vampire Coast. While assaulting a hidden chamber, powerful glyphs rebounded Harkon’s sorcery, shattering his mind into many warring personalities and severing him from the Winds of Magic. Harkon’s multiple identities now battle for dominance but they have one common goal, to plunder the sacred places of the Lizardmen and use the power of their Slann artefacts to break the curse and heal his damaged mind.Count NoctilusCount Noctilus, once known as Nyklaus von Carstein of Sylvania, was drawn to the maelstrom at the heart of the ocean to feast upon its dark magic. He performed a mighty ritual to transport himself, his castle and all his undead minions there to the Galleon’s Graveyard, a mystical place where wrecks and hulks of the seas are drawn. Reborn as Count Noctilus, he raised the shattered remains of sunken warships to form the hull of the Bloody Reaver and ride the waves of the mortal seas once more.Aranessa SaltspiteQueen of the Tides, Aranessa Saltspite is one of the most respected and feared pirate captains of Sartosa. Some say she is the daughter of the sea god Manann himself and he whispers to her to take control of all the world’s oceans. Now, many a sea-bloated corpse washes up against the Swordfysh’s hull, and so the Vampire first mates breathe unlife into them, creating a vast rabble of loyal crew, ready to serve at Captain Saltspite’s command. As part of the living realm rather than the undead, she commands a human pirate crew known as the Sartosa Free Company, otherwise reluctantly sharing control of the denizens of the Vampire Coast.Cylostra DirefinLegend has it that the sea witch Cylostra Direfin was once the favourite court singer of the Bretonnian king. Sent on a voyage across the ocean to sing for the Phoenix King, they were hit by a fierce storm. The madame’s notes turned to screams of fury as the ship sank, and all onboard drowned. Decades later, a Bretonnian galleon of rotten wood and tattered sails can be seen navigating the seas even in the most savage of storms. It is The Lamprey, the ship of the vengeful spirit Madame Cylostra and her crew, the Drowned.Army RosterLords:Vampire Fleet Admiral with male and female variants.Lore’s of Magic: Death, Deep, Vampires Heroes:Vampire Fleet CaptainLore’s of Magic: Death, Deep, Vampires Gunnery WightMourngul Haunter Core Units:Animated HulkBloated CorpseCarronadeDeath Shriek TerrorgheistDeck DroppersDeck Droppers (Bombers)Deck Droppers (Handguns)Deck GunnersDepth GuardDepth Guard (Polearms)Fell BatsMortarMourngulsNecrofex ColossusRotting Leviathan Rotting PrometheansRotting Prometheans Gunnery MobScurvy DogsSyreensZombie Deckhands MobZombie Deckhands Mob (Polearm)Zombie Gunnery MobZombie Gunnery Mob (Handguns)Zombie Pirate Gunnery Mob (Bombers)Zombie Pirate Gunnery Mob (Hand Cannon)Exclusive Units:Sartosa Free Company (Aranessa: Pirates of Sartosa Only)Sartosa Militia (Aranessa: Pirates of Sartosa Only)Queen Bess (Campaign Rite – One per game)Regiments of RenownGallows Giant (Necrofex Colossus)Night Terrors (Mournguls)Salt Lord Scuttlers (Deck Droppers - Bombers)Shadewraith Gunners (Deck Gunners)The Black Spot (Zombie Pirate Gunnery Mob - Handguns)The Bloody Reaver Deck Guard (Depth Guard)The Lamprey's Revenge (Rotting Prometheans Gunnery Mob)The Tide of Skjold (Zombie Deckhands Mob)\",\n",

Many of the iconic warlords of Total War: THREE KINGDOMS have now passed on, a catalyst that has spurred a new generation of warlords into making a play for their own dynasties.As well as adding in more factions to the South, A World Betrayed includes:Two new factions led by fan favourites Lü Bu and Sun Ce13 playable factionsNew unique battlefield unitsNew faction mechanicsNew events and story missionsNew legendary charactersNew story eventsA brand-new 194 CE start dateAll sons are born in the shadow of their fathers. It’s how they move beyond that defines them.The year is 194CE and Dong Zhuo, the seemingly unstoppable tyrant, has been dead for two years. But his death blow did not come from an enemy hand; the blade belonged to Lü Bu, his adoptive son. Since Dong Zhuo’s death, Lü Bu has flirted with a number of allegiances, swiftly falling in (and out) with the warlords he finds around him. Having found further opportunities by taking Cao Cao’s land while he was away avenging the death of his father, he now flees from Cao Cao and his allies, seeking further means to prove his battle prowess and defeat the supposed heroes of China.Meanwhile in the South, Sun Ce mourns his own father’s death, Sun Jian. Vowing to defend his legacy, he seeks expansion into the South, but can he keep his people safe and prove his worth beyond his father’s legacy?With the world in turmoil, it’s up to you to carve out a path for your hero, and lay waste to anyone that stands in your way.Lü BuThe legendary warrior Lü Bu may be fearsome in battle, but he is hasty when it comes to the intricacies of rule. At the start of his campaign players will find themselves locked in combat with Cao Cao’s main army. Fight your way out of Chen to survive and rally your forces for the next inevitable showdown. This is the only DLC in which Lü Bu and his faction become playable.Unique Faction Mechanics: Momentum: Lü Bu’s faction centres around Lü Bu himself defeating enemies as faction leader. Defeating enemy characters grants momentum points which enable a variety of powerful actions and bonuses.Greatest Warrior Panel: Lü Bu’s faction has access to the ‘Greatest Warriors’ panel, featuring legendary warriors from the Three Kingdoms period. Defeating these legendary warriors with Lü Bu unlocks various permanent bonuses for the faction.Unique Story Events:Experience the historic conflict between Cao Cao and Lü BuLü Bu’s shifting allegiances: will you join Liu Bei, and later betray him?Lü Bu’s fractured faction: Will your generals betray you? When playing as Lü Bu you also have access to two new units; Camp Crushers (two-handed sword infantry)Flying Riders (armoured shock cavalry)Sun CeThe military general Sun Ce is a vassal of Yuan Shu at the start of this campaign, as his father Sun Jian was before him. In Sun Ce’s campaign the player must grapple with decisions around the overlord; should Sun Ce stay loyal or should he rebel? With a desire to push South and conquer his homelands, Sun Ce has a fraught journey ahead of him. Unique Faction Mechanic: Legacy Of Wu: Sun Ce has a list of ‘ambitions’ and completing these goals grants permanent bonuses to his faction. This includes tasks such as conquering lands in the south, gathering high-level characters into his court and getting vengeance for his father’s murder.Reckless Luck: Sun Ce’s reckless behaviour lets him expand his kingdom with unmatched speed and ease. But the luck that keeps him alive can’t be sustained forever. If his luck runs out, Sun Ce dies. By completing his ambitions, his death can be delayed and, perhaps, avoided. Unique Story Events:Guide Sun Ce’s unbridled ambition and reckless confidence into conquering the South.Experience Sun Ce’s conflict with Yan Baihu and Yuan Shu.Prove your worth, and Sun Jian’s old generals will flock to your faction.When playing as Sun Ce you also have access to two new units and his father’s mercenary units.Tiger Guard (heavy spear infantry)Handmaid Guard (medium sword cavalry)Mercenary Archers (light bow infantry)Mercenary Infantry (medium axe infantry)Mercenary Cavalry (medium spear cavalry)Returning HeroesAs well as our two new factions, A World Betrayed sees a brand-new start date and brand-new challenges for the following returning factions:Cao CaoLiu BeiYuan ShaoYuan ShuLiu BiaoZhang YanZheng JiangGongsun ZanKong RongMa Teng',\n",

In the game you play the role of the base architect and manager, telling your colonists where to build the structures they will need to survive. You will have to ensure that they have a constant supply of oxygen, food and water to stay alive.You will get them to collect energy, extract water, mine metal, grow food, manufacture bots, and build a fully self-sufficient base in a harsh environment, where you are always one step away from total failure.Even if the game is not intended to be a simulator, all the mechanics are plausible, and based on what the expected challenges of establishing a colony in an new planet would be.Features:    Four different planets with different conditions and increasing difficulty.    Harness solar and wind energy (if available) in order to power the base's structures.    Grow hydroponic Vegetables and synthesize Vitromeat to feed your population.    Mine and produce raw resources, process them, manufacture goods, and establish a production chain.    Carefully manage the colonist immigration flow to ensure you have the people with the right skills.    Survive disasters like meteors, sandstorms or solar flares and defend your base from intruders.    Mechanize your base by creating your own bots that will help with the more arduous tasks.    Grow your colony from a few initial pioneers to a vibrant planetbase with hundreds of colonists.\",\n",

Prepare for dark hexes and flesh made out of mud and decay, if you dare enter Backwater Swamp and live through the horror it brings. A new killer - The Hag - awaits you in the waterland area and you will meet a new survivor: Ace Visconti.A hag driven to madness by being devoured alive piece by piece. A survivor that believes luck is always on his side. A wetland with scorched shacks, an eerie mud maze and a rusting boat graveyard lays ahead of you, so tread carefully.Of Flesh and Mud is the brand new Chapter for Dead by Daylight and it includes a new Killer, a new Survivor and a map. Haunted by The HagThe unspeakable torment Lisa Sherwood endured twisted her mind and carved in the memory of pain in her bones. She had a choice, to flee or to turn on her tormentors. Her last deed drove her into darkness.From Dust to DustSource of The Hag's power, a blackened finger used as a catalyst to her terrible power: the Phantasm Traps. The Hag draws in the soil to set a trap for the survivors. When a survivor finds her trap, a lifelike illusion of the killer appears in front of them. Once the trap is triggered, The Hag has a choice. To enter the physical illusion when the survivors are within her reach or use it as a decoy to take down her unsuspecting prey before the phantasm collapses into pieces of dirt and mud.Killer PerksThe Hag perks revolve around a new gameplay mechanic: the Hex totems. They are focused on cursing the survivors and sapping their abilities.RuinAn ominous hex that affects the survivors' skills at repairing generators. Survivors affected by Ruin suffer the following in their desperate fight for survival:Good Skill checks results in regression on the generator.Great Skill checks do not grant bonus progression on the generator.Devour HopeA hex rooting its power on hope. The false hope of survivors ignites your hunger. When a survivor is rescued from a hook at least 24 meters away, Devour Hope receives a token. Tokens grant various abilities such as double damage and kill by your own hand.The Third SealYou will curse a survivor by hitting the victim while the Hex Totem is active. The hex reduces the effectiveness of the victim's aura reading ability and make the survivor easy prey. But only one survivor can have this curse at a time. Once you hit another survivor, the Hex is transferred to your next victim.Are you feeling lucky?Ace Visconti is one charming guy. From his roots as a poor boy in Argentina, he gamed, scammed, seduced and smooth-talked his way to a life of luxury as a high roller in the land of opportunity. Money has always had a way of slipping through his fingers, but Ace simply figures he can always win more. Eventually he racked up too many debts with the wrong kind of people. But when they finally came to collect, Ace was nowhere to be found. No one knows where he has gone, but everyone agrees on one thing: He will survive… against all odds.Luck favors the boldAce is one lucky bastard or at least he believes he is. Therefore, he’s always ready to take a chance. Ace in the HoleLady Luck always seems to be throwing something good your way. When retrieving an item from a chest, there is a chance that an add-on of very rare rarity or lower attached to it.Up the AnteYour confidence strengthens the feeling of hope for those around you. For each other survivor still alive, grant bonus to luck to all remaining survivors.Open-HandedLuck is more than chance, it takes a bit of skill thrown in. You stay alert at all times. Strengthens potential in one's aura reading ability and increases aura reading ranges.A feast on human fleshIt wasn’t until the authorities decided to drain the waters around the ramshackle collection of huts that the true history of Backwater Swamp began to unravel. Thirty-seven sets of human remains weighted down in the rotten swamp waters was revealed. Bodies that showed traced of being cut in and their bones carefully scraped free of flesh. As for the family that hunted in these waters, nothing was ever found of them. The buildings where they once lived were burnt and scorched and everything was covered in black ashes. The rumor claims that they torched it all to cover up their deeds, before fleeing into the darkest reaches of the swamp, to one day begin their foul hunt again.The wreck of The Pale RoseThe Pale Rose, an ancient paddle steamer in the middle of the swamp, held captive of the stagnant mud. It has been here long before the residents began their hunt, a barely visible silhouette from the nearby village. There are signs of inhabitation, particularly in the upper states room where strange, ritualistic markings in dried blood and dirt cover the floor.  From the scale of the bloodletting, something horrid has taken place here.\",\n",

In this time of need, the first Immortals came into their uncanny powers, powers so great that they succeeded in destroying the beast ravaging the land, where all else had failed.To prevent such destruction from ever happening again, the Immortals banded together to form a Council that would enforce order and stability on a global scale, stepping in at any hint of war or chaos. The Immortals might be vastly powerful, but they are few. Even they can't oversee all of the lands. This is why they rely upon their mortal agents, the Arbiters, to guard the land's people from the more day-to-day dangers they face. Arbiters range over the land, rooting out bandits, unruly monsters, and crooked officials; their word is law. But one Arbiter uncovers the deepening corruption pervading her own order, and it falls to her to halt the spread of a threat as dire as the brutal beast of yore.Strongly influenced by games such as Final Fantasy Tactics (original and Advance versions) and Tactics Ogre, this tactical RPG stands on its own as a worthy successor of those classics, bringing a slew of improvements and additions to the tactics genre.\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"About This ContentShattered Bloodline  is a brand-new Chapter for Dead by Daylight, which includes a new Map. Purchasing the Shattered Bloodline DLC will unlock its new Killer, new Survivor, and an exclusive item for the new survivor.What lies beneath the mundane can be terrifying. Under the layers of quaint family life, violence festers. When this dark rampant force lashes out, lives are broken and families shattered. Wrath was her bloodline. She came home to find unimaginable horrors, which left their mark. Now she walks, haunting and vengeful, between this world and the next.  Adam Francis has no legacy, no inheritance. Everything he owns, he had to earn. Disciplined and driven, he knows he can do anything when he puts his mind to it.  His hard work paid off when he found a job miles away from home. Now living in Japan, he shares the hard lessons he had to learn on his own.     The SpiritShe inherited incredible fury from her ancestors. The wrath that flows through her veins is her legacy. The terrible pain she suffered set it off. Swift and lethal, The Spirit exacts her revenge endlessly. The Spirit is a phase-walking Killer able to catch Survivors off-guard with her traversal power, Yamaoka’s Haunting. Killer Power - The Spirit: Yamaoka’s HauntingYamoka is the name she carries from her ancestors, who unleashed hell on the battlefield. The Spirit draws her power from their wrath, haunting the living as retribution for her suffering. The Spirit can use her power, Yamaoka’s Haunting, to enter an ethereal plane and phase-walk to a new location, unseen by human eyes. While Yamaoka’s Haunting is active:-The Spirit may traverse freely to a new location, moving at a faster rate for a short duration. She is still confined to movement within the physical environments and surroundings.-The Spirit leaves the physical plane, losing sight of all Survivors. She can, however, still sense the scratch marks they leave in the environment.-The Spirit will produce an audible cue at her current location. Once the power has ended, The Spirit retains her speed boost for a brief period and her husk fades away.Using Yamaoka’s Haunting depletes The Spirit's power bar. The power bar will automatically replenish over time. The power bar must be fully replenished before it can be triggered again.The Spirit comes with 3 new perks.Spirit FuryEvery time a pallet is broken, the fury of The Entity builds within. After breaking 4/3/2 pallets, the next dropped pallet you interact with will be instantly broken by the Entity.Hex: Haunted GroundSpawn 2 trapped Hex Totems. When 1 of the 2 trapped Hex Totems is cleansed by a Survivor, all Survivors suffer from the Exposed Status Effect for 40/50/60 seconds. The remaining trapped Hex Totem immediately becomes a Dull Totem.RancorObsession Perk when a Generator is completed. The Obsession location is revealed to you for 3 seconds and the Obsession sees your aura for 5/4/3 seconds. When the Obsession is dead, all Survivors location are revealed to you for 3 seconds each time a Generator is completed. The Inspiring TeacherBorn and raised in Kingston, Jamaica, Adam is a resourceful teacher whose expectations of himself and others are higher than most. He is a driven autodidact who always strives to improve himself. Finding opportunity miles away from his island, he built a new home from scratch. In Japan, he was seen as a hard teacher with a good heart. While he was tough during class, he held study sessions every day after school and spent hours answering any student’s questions.  His kind nature allows him to adapt easily and resolve difficult situations. Adam’s personal perks help him to distract The Killer, survive desperate situations, and become more skilled as the trial continues.Adam Francis comes with 3 new perks.DiversionActivatable Perk. Standing within the Killer Terror Radius while not in a chase for 45 seconds activates the perk. Once the perk is activated, press the Active Ability button while crouched and motionless to throw a pebble, which creates a loud noise notification for The Killer at a distance of  10/15/20 Meters. The perk deactivates once it has been used. “There’s what is easy and then there’s what is right. If you confuse the two, there’s no telling what you become.” Adam FrancisDeliveranceAfter performing a safe hook rescue on another Survivor, the perk activates. You now have a 100% chance to unhook yourself during the escape attempt. A successful Deliverance from the hook triggers the Broken status effect for 100/80/60 seconds. “I was raised by a strict man who taught me how to make the best of a bad situation.” Adam FrancisAutodidactYou start the trial with a -25% progression penalty for Skill Checks to heal Survivors. For every successful Skill Check completed while healing a Survivor, you receive a Token for a maximum of 3/4/5 Tokens. Each Token grants you a +15% bonus progression for a successful Skill Check while healing Survivors. Great Skill Checks cannot be performed while using Autodidact. Autodidact is not active when using a Med Kit to heal.“There’s no limit to what you can achieve, as long as you back it up with hard work.” Adam FrancisExclusive Item for AdamThe Shattered Bloodline Chapter includes an exclusive item for Adam, the Graduation Day Suit, only available as part of the DLC. Please note that this item cannot be purchased separately.  THE YAMAOKA ESTATE: FAMILY RESIDENCE The estate was bought by the first of the Yamaoka, a shipwreck survivor, who came from a distant ashy island. He washed ashore just as political tensions sparked the flames of war. Yamaoka joined the battlefield and unleashed hell on his foes. No one could match the raw fury of his katana, which elevated him to a legend. They say his devilish mask haunted the dreams of all men. His fame grew as he spilled blood on both sides of the conflict. With power came wealth, which he used to buy the estate and begin his legacy. The land was passed down from one generation to the next, each one leaving its mark on the landscape. The garden grew and expended through the ages. Now only an old maple tree remains untouched from Yamaoka’s era, representing the whole family. While the Yamaoka estate displayed a glorious past, the family residence was falling apart. The house needed numerous renovations to remain habitable. The last generation of the Yamaoka family were facing troubled times. Their finances were dire and the situation worsened when the daughter started university, just a few months before the mother became ill. Shouldering both university fees and hospital bills, the father worked past exhaustion. To keep a roof over their heads, he profaned their legacy. The walls of their ancestral home were sealed with moldy materials for a cheap fix. As the house was stripped of its integrity, an old anger was awakened.\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"A tactical FPS with online team-based action game play that takes place in a variety of locations in Bangladesh with Real-life scale & resource management. Inspired by various other tactical shooter games, Zero Hour tries to bring a very grounded CO-OP and Team vs Team experience in locations with real-life scale (no video game scale) and resource management. In multiplayer, both sides are tasked to wipe out the other team and complete objectives. The defenders are tasked to protect the bomb from being defused and keep their hostage from being rescued and running away. On the contrary, the attackers are to defuse the bomb or rescue the hostage held captive. In the CO-OP mode, based on the map you decide to play in, will have several objectives that will need to be completed in order to call for extraction. TACTICAL GAMEPLAYZero Hour brings a very grounded CO-OP, 5v5, team vs team, Close quarter combat experience to the game that focuses on two teams with each player having their own roles. The attackers utilizing shields, weapons and the planning table and the terrorists utilizing traps and gadgets in order to fortify the area.CO-OPCO-OP mode is a new installment we added where players can play to achieve the experience of SWAT units. This game mode will allow you to play bigger operations that you can either tackle solo or with a team of up to 5. With each operation, you are tasked to complete objectives such as bringing order to chaos. There are more objectives such as rescuing multiple hostages, arresting or neutralizing specific suspects and more which are being added down the line. Suspects may or may not have patrolling routes that are random every session and can interact with the environment to give it a challenge. They can hide under beds, tables and inside closets. They are also capable of taking a hostage and use them as a shield, making it harder for you to engage. Suspects can also surrender based on a few criteria; If a suspect is outnumbered from behind they will always surrender and if you are one on one with a suspect, based on the suspect's fear level, they may or may not surrender. PLANNING TABLEAt the start of each round, MS-09 Unit (The Attacking Team) can come up with strategies by drawing in the planning table with a 3D miniature version of the location being played similar to the use of blueprints. It can be used to direct teammates where to spawn and/or advance from. There are 3 types of marker that you can place around the planning table which can indicate danger and objectives. During this phase, The Terrorists (The Defending Team) will be given time to place traps and gadgets to aid in their defense strategy.RESOURCE MANAGEMENTBoth Teams have resources that they need to manage per 3 rounds. The Attacking Team has 2 sets of 5 types of weapons while The Defending Team has 5 sets of 5 types of gadgets. This is crucial in terms of saving your resources, picking up and utilizing your opponent’s weapons, and not giving an advantage to your enemies HOSTAGEThe hostage held captive by the defenders will have its own mindset which means it would run away if not careful. This indicates that it would be critical to keep an eye on the hostage and move it around wherever a player feels necessary. DOORSIn order to bring a realistic approach, the doors help in encouraging slow and tactical gameplay. It would cause both teams to hesitate before entering a room since it will be oblivious to know what’s going on behind the door. BREAKER SWITCHThe switch causes a complete blackout of the whole operation building that you're playing on. By doing this, the players won’t be able to visualize their surroundings unless they use the tactical flashlight.\",\n",

       "  'short_bio': 'Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic is the ultimate real-time soviet-themed city builder tycoon game. Construct your own republic and transform a poor country into a rich industrial superpower!',\n",
       "  'full_bio': \"Manage all aspects of your own republic with planned economy, including mining resources, manufacturing goods, construction, investments, and citizens too.Create your own industrial complexes with loading and unloading stations, storage, warehouses, and factories.Build the infrastructure and manage its traffic, including roads, railways, sidewalks, conveyors, wiring, and pipelines. Wisely place and connect factories, houses and warehouses, and make the most efficient connections.Plan and build the living areas with everything your citizens may need to live their happy life, such as playgrounds, cinema s, taverns, and shops.Send your citizens to the mine to get coal, iron and other natural resources; or send them to the fields to pick up the crops; or take them to factories to produce manufactured goods.Sell and purchase resources and goods from western countries or other soviet countries to get dollars or rubles and buy the products or resources you need ... or invest in new infrastructure or buildings.Enjoy authentic soviet buildings and vehicles, as well as realistic landscapes of the 60's to the 90's.Play the way you want! You can focus on getting natural resources or products and trade them for money; or you can build a self-sufficient republic; or you can just use the easy sandbox mode with unlimited money/resources and just enjoy building something live.Economic simulation. Prices of resources on the global market are changing over time as you play –one day you can sell or purchase steel for a $100 per ton, but in a few months the cost can rise to $200 or decrease to $50. The price of everything is connected to the cost of work and resources.Increasing difficulty.As prices change, the demands of the citizens also change, and you will need more resources to keep them happy and force them to work.RESOURCES & INDUSTRYThere are, right now, over 30 commodities you can mine, transport and manufacture. If you want to get clothes you will first need to get resources to create a fabric, then you will need a clothing factory where the clothes will be manufactured from this fabric. You can then transport the finished clothes into shops where your citizens can buy them.Every commodity has a specific requirement,so if you would like to load oil into the tank train-car you will need a special pumping loading station. If you need to load gravel into a dumper truck you need a special loading station where the gravel comes from conveyors into the truck. Liquid resources like oil or fuel can be stored only in tanks, while resources like wood, steel, or prefabricated concrete panels can be stored outside in the open space. Using a crane for these will increase loading/unloading speed. Goods like clothes, food, etc. can be stored in warehouses.WORKERS AND THEIRS DEMANDSEvery worker/citizen goes to work each day. If they work for you, they have demands. At the start of the game they are satisfied just with food, but as a time goes on they may have more demands like meat, clothes, alcohol or electronics. Also, to have happy workers you need places where they can spend their leisure time – cinema, playgrounds, taverns, etc.Every worker has an education level. They can go to school or college to improve this level. If their education is too low they cannot work; if their education is high enough they can be a teacher, or researcher, or work in factories with special requirements.TRANSPORTATIONYou have many options for how you will manage resources and goods transportation. If you get raw iron ore from a mine, you need to process it. Then you need to transport it somehow into a steel mill to produce steel. You can build the processing plant and steel mill near to the mine and transport it all by conveyors, or you can transport iron ore into a steel mill by train fora longer distance. It is up to you to decide from where the workers will go into the factories. You can create residential zones and transport workers by buses or trains to industrial areas. You can also build residential buildings near the factories so that workers will able to walk to the factory. But don't forget that a worker will need to purchase food and enjoy their free time, so again it is up to you to decide whether to build those facilities near their home or whether you will transport them somehow to shops or places to spend their free time.ECONOMY SIMULATION The game simulates the economy system. There are no fixed prices! Costs of everything are defined by the economic situation. For example, the cost of steel is calculated from the price of iron, coal and work, and also partially from the cost of steel mill construction.You purchase or sell commodities for money (dollars or rubles). But be careful, as it is possible that if you buy or sell for high values you will affect the price of the commodity on the market. You may be able to purchase for a higher price or sell it cheaper.As time increases, so does complexity. Some resources or products may become more expensive (as, for example, less human work is needed with advanced technologies), so later with more complexity, it may be necessary to be as self-sufficient as possible.\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"About This Software** Please read this section before purchasing! **- OVR Toolkit *only* supports Windows 10! Not Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1.- OVR Toolkit *requires* you to have a Windows account with admin permissions and that you run Steam on this same account.- Oculus users may experience decreased performance as games are required to be ran through SteamVR rather than Oculus Runtime. (Read the 'Important Stuff' section!)Oculus Rift or Oculus Quest users - Read the 'Important Stuff' section before purchase!OverviewOVR Toolkit is a SteamVR Overlay utility designed to make viewing the desktop within VR easy and intuitive. OVR Toolkit allows you to display specific desktop windows, quickly select between them, use intuitive controls to navigate those windows, and use a virtual keyboard to type.Ever wanted to reply to Discord messages without taking off your headset or looking through a nose piece? Ever wanted to pause that song you're listening to without fumbling around on your keyboard? Now you can with ease!OVR Toolkit is compatible with mostly all SteamVR compatible headsets, though it does require tracked controllers too! The utility is being built with the Vive/Vive Pro, Valve Index, and Oculus Rift/Rift S in mind though WMR headsets are compatible too. (Compatible controllers require a trigger and grip)Features Overlays over almost all SteamVR applications: OVR Toolkit will display on top of all your favorite titles! (VRChat, Beat Saber, mostly all SteamVR titles, etc.) Desktop window viewing: Allows you to select a desktop window and display it above your hand, or pin it in the world around you. Multiple desktop windows: Create multiple different windows and place them in the world around you. Attach windows to tracked devices: You can make windows move around with either your left or right controllers, headset, or have them stationary in the world. Curved overlays: Improves readability of large windows in VR by wrapping them around you by a configurable amount? Now you can! (Or you can make the window into a wall by curving it to the max, I don't judge!) Window re-centering: Optionally enable window re-centering, this will make window's re-appear in front of you when you open Edit Mode. This is useful to easily pull windows to you so you can use them. Quick selection of desktop windows: OVR Toolkit contains a configuration 'hotkey' menu that allows you to bind buttons on its UI to switch between specific windows in one click. Intuitive desktop input: Scroll up and down on windows by dragging, make a selection by dragging, like using your finger on a phone but with a VR controller instead! (This makes a lot more sense than it sounds like it does!) Wristwatch: An overlay displayed on your hand that displays the time, date, as well as Vive/Index controller/Tracker battery percentages, as well as other values such as Vive Wireless temperatures. Saving/Loading configurations: Like that sweet setup you've made? Well, now you can save it, and load it again next time you launch! Advanced settings for window capture: Want that 60 FPS window capture experience? Want to make a window slightly transparent so it's less in the way? Want a window to disappear when you're not looking at it? Or when it's past a set distance from you? You can do these with our advanced settings! Eco Mode: When enabled, performance mode will lower the capture rate of windows you are not using, this drastically increases performance and lowers CPU usage significantly! Basic media controls: Spotify currently playing song will show on your wrist, along with a play/pause, skip, and previous button. (These buttons will work in other music players too)Customization Customize the background (wallpaper) and logo on the phone-like UI. Choose between several accent colors for various parts of the UI. Create hotkeys on the home page that show application's icons and allow you to quickly access your commonly used applications. Customize keyboard layouts! All keyboard layouts are community made within Unity and documentation is provided so you can do this yourself. (Want the keys to spell out funny things like you're in high school again? Now you can!) Custom apps (Coming Soon tm) will allow you and others to create custom 'apps' to run within OVR Toolkit that can spawn new overlays and display web pages. (For example, an app could be made which opens Twitch chat and events automatically) - Join our Discord for information on this W.I.P feature!Simulator Mode - Controller-free mode'Simulator Mode' is a controller-free mode available in OVR Toolkit. In this mode, you can interact with windows using head gaze, and use keyboard binds to move windows around you and change their settings. This mode is perfect for those intending to use OVR Toolkit at a desk or whilst in a sim racing/driving/piloting game!(This mode is still a work in progress, provide feedback in the OVR Toolkit Discord!) Move windows with keyboard binds when you have no controllers connected. Control your cursor position with your head using head-gaze input. Pin windows around you in your play space to view whilst in games. (Race overlays, etc.) Quickly toggle open windows with the 'Edit Mode' bind to show/hide some applications such as Discord, web browsers, etc. whilst in games. Voice Attack ready. (All controls are easily repeatable with the same keyboard key presses to support Voice Attack)Important stuff you should know aboutWe've tried our best to make OVR Toolkit support everything, but that just isn't how this world works!Please take these compatibility notes in mind before purchasing: OVR Toolkit requires being launched as admin, this is due to the inability to capture programs that are running as admin without running OVR Toolkit as admin, so it's needless to say a Windows account with admin privileges is needed. (If you're the only user of your PC, this is probably you) OVR Toolkit only supports Windows 10. (This is due to the desktop capture API we use which was only introduced in Windows 10) Oculus users, don't launch OVR Toolkit through Oculus Home as it will launch the application incorrectly! Use Steam/SteamVR instead! You can set OVR Toolkit to auto-start with SteamVR by referring to our wiki! Oculus' software will sometimes overlay over our overlay. (This is because Oculus' software displays separate to SteamVR, our application will always display whilst SteamVR is active or you're playing a SteamVR game, just not when you open the Oculus Dashboard) We cannot display our application over Oculus SDK games. (Our application uses SteamVR to display, though, most Oculus games will have a SteamVR mode, we advise you use this!) Running games through SteamVR on an Oculus headset may decrease performance, this is not an issue specific to OVR Toolkit. This is due to Oculus rendering the same image twice, once when SteamVR compositor renders the output, then again when Oculus Runtime renders the output. Unfortunately, this is something only Oculus/Facebook can fix! If you have any issues with the application or find other comparability issues, don't hesitate to contact us! We'll whip up a hotfix ASAP!\",\n",

Who knows, you might even receive a free Crytivo game every now and then.WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THE POWER?Jump straight into managing your own planets as you guide a civilization through the ages.  Build the ultimate empire in The Universim, a new breed of God Game in development by Crytivo.Want to participate in Closed Alpha and Beta Tests of The Universim? Subscribe to the Newsletter and we’ll let you know when the CBT begins!WANNA BE A GOD?Your time is coming. Guide a fledgling civilization through the obstacles of life. From humble beginnings, watch as they evolve and advance throughout the ages under your wing. Influence their decisions and punish the unfaithful with a wide range of godly abilities. Interact with objects, create disasters, and launch clueless creatures into orbit. This is your world, and nothing can stop you from having fun.Our goal is to bring back the features you know and love from classic god games and spice them up with fresh ideas, a modern physics engine, and stylized visuals developed by a few of our very own industry heroes.THE STORY OF A SPECIESMeet the Nuggets, a fragile and whacky species that relies on your leadership to build, research, and advance. Help them, and they will soon begin writing their own history in the stars. Every Nugget is a unique individual with a distinct set of characteristics. Just like any other living creature, Nuggets must have access to a few vital resources in order to survive. This includes water to drink, food to eat, and recreational activities to increase their happiness and quality of life. Recreational activities may include blowing stuff up. You’ve been warned.As you spend time with the Nuggets, you will begin to notice that they behave like natural, living beings. They have their own thoughts and needs, as well as the ability to act in dynamic and interesting ways. While the beginning of the game will require more management to ensure the survival of your civilization, Nuggets will slowly evolve and learn how to handle more tasks on their own, resulting in you being able to switch over to a more macro-level role and tackle even greater challenges. ORGANIC GAMEPLAYPlanets in The Universim aren’t just made up of a bunch of neatly-arranged objects; everything is linked together and plays a unique role in each planet’s ecosystem. Every tree your civilization cuts down, every resource they mine and every animal they hunt will affect the world they’re living in. A lack of trees and high levels of pollution will raise the global temperature over time, while reckless hunting or fishing might cause the extinction of some species. It’s your mission to manage how the Nuggets collect and utilize resources. What mark will you leave on the ecosystems that existed millions of years before your arrival? Will you use every available resource and expand at an unprecedented pace, or will you methodically create a more sustainable way of life for your civilization?NATURE AS YOU KNOW ITIn The Universim, nature is just as wonderful and unpredictable as ever. Every planet comes with a few surprises that are sure to challenge your civilization. From tornadoes that consume everything in their path, to thunderous earthquakes that threaten to split your civilization in two. If you treat nature poorly, it might just show you how brutal and unforgiving it can be. Each planet you encounter will have a unique underbelly. Some planets are tranquil and filled to the brim with resources, while others are barren and dangerous. Be careful out there!Something as simple as the cycle between night and day can play an important role. Wild animal attacks are more common at night, as are frequent temperature drops. Daytime offers a little more safety from the harshness of the world. With the inclusion of a full, four-season cycle, a planet’s biomes can change drastically, making it extremely difficult for Nuggets to survive brutal winters without proper preparation ahead of time.

       "  'full_bio': \"About This ContentCurtain Call is a brand new chapter for Dead by Daylight. It includes a new Killer, a Survivor and a Map as well as an exclusive item for the new survivor. People often speak of the tears of a clown, of the sadness that lies beneath the greasepaint smile. What if that wasn’t sadness, but a deep malevolence, born of a life spent in the pursuit of drink and gluttony? A mind that sees others only as vessels for torture, and reduces their bodies down to a single finger, a trophy to be added to a collection? For something like that to survive, it would have to wear a disguise, cloak itself in a brighter aspect and a broad smile, even if it were just painted on.Kate Denson’s smile is genuine, friendly and warm. She sings of love and life, family and hope. She holds those values dear, and will fight anyone who tries to destroy them. Carnival of Souls Carnivals are places of fun and laughter, of color and light, beacons of happiness in the dark. Make sure not to walk too far from the crowds and music, to be lured by the painted panels and inviting light of that lonely caravan, or you just might find one of your fingers added to the Clown’s collection.Macabre Mementos The Clown has long used his nomadic lifestyle as a cover for his twisted pastimes. He distanced himself from a society that hated and feared him, living as a parasite, enticing those who strayed too near, anesthetizing and trapping them like butterflies. Beware, if you feel your senses dulling and your head getting light, RUN!Killer Power - The Clown: The Afterpiece TonicThroughout his years experimenting with anesthetics and muscle relaxants, The Clown developed several effective concoctions and formulas. He used his favorite, The Afterpiece Tonic, to great effect, intoxicating and capturing many unwilling victims.Tap or hold and release the Power button to launch a bottle of The Afterpiece Tonic. On contact, the bottle breaks, emitting a gas cloud that intoxicates any survivors within the area of effect.Intoxicated Survivors suffer from impaired vision, reduced movement speed, and involuntary coughing for 1.5 seconds.Press and hold the Active Ability button to replenish your bottles of The Afterpiece Tonic.The Clown comes with 3 new perks.The Clown has a surprising agility for a man of his size, along with a terrifying appearance and the ability to sabotage the Survivor’s efforts.BamboozleYour Vault speed is faster. Performing a Vault action calls upon The Entity to block that vault location temporarily.Only one vault location may be blocked in this way at any time. The vault location is blocked only for Survivors.CoulrophobiaAll survivors healing within your Terror Radius have a penalty to healing speed.Pop goes the WeaselAfter hooking a Survivor, the next generator you break is instantly regressed by a chunk. Normal generator regression applies after the damage is done.Pop goes the Weasel is active for a limited time after the Survivor is hooked.Hopeful SongbirdKate Denson’s life was one of spreading joy and warmth to those around her. She made friends easily and friends soon became like family. Somehow she ended up here, where the only warmth comes from a bonfire and there is no joy to be found. Her attitude hasn’t changed though and she will do all she can to protect the new friends she makes. Kate Denson comes with 3 new perks.Windows of OpportunityUnlocks potential in one's aura reading ability. Auras of pallets and vaults are revealed to you when within range.Windows of Opportunity has a cooldown when vaulting or dropping a pallet during a chase.Boil OverYou are a battler and do everything to escape a foe's grasp. Your struggling effects on the Killer are increased.You obscure the Killers ability to see hook auras within range.Dance with meWhen performing a fast vault or leaving a locker in a sprint, you leave no scratch marks for a limited time.Dance with me has a cooldown.Exclusive Item for KateThe Curtain Call Chapter includes an exclusive item for Kate, the Midday Slip Dress, only available as part of the DLC (not if you purchase each character separately).  Campbell’s ChapelFather Campbell’s Chapel was once a haven from the horrors of the rest of the asylum. Patients would come here for refuge, to seek guidance from the Father and to unburden their souls. Then, on that fateful night, the Asylum’s halls fell quiet and the Father met his end in the confessional that had helped so many.Now it has been joined by a strange companion: a brightly colored caravan, pulled by a shadowy horse. Only a fool would let the bright colors seduce them into visiting…\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"About This ContentCursed Legacy is a new Chapter for Dead by Daylight. It includes a Killer, The Oni, a Survivor, Yui Kimura and a Map. Purchasing the add-on will unlock its new Killer, new Survivor, and an exclusive item for the survivor.The Cursed Legacy Chapter includes a new map, the Sanctum of Wrath. The Oni is the new Killer. A former Samurai corrupted by the Entity and turned into a dark reflection of his inner angst, a hideous creature of rage, an embodiment of wrath and cruelty that reigns terror upon his victims.  The new survivor is Yui Kimura. A rebel against traditions, a protector to those who cannot protect themselves, an exceptional motorcyclist who suddenly finds herself in an endless race for her life. The Cursed Legacy Chapter also features an exclusive cosmetic item: Yui's Pink Striped Top.What does it mean to be authentic? How does one follow one’s destiny despite the pressures of family and tradition? Often following one‘s path is a strenuous, narrow struggle full of unexpected joys and difficulties. Ultimately it’s about finding the balance between tradition and self-actualization. But as one struggles for identity, decisions are made and consequences, good or bad, must be faced. The OniHeir to a famous Japanese swordsmanship school, Kazan Yamaoka sought to surpass his reputation as a warrior by turning his back on honor and family and embarking on a dark pilgrimage of bloodlust. As he waged his personal war against self-proclaimed samurai, he was bestowed with the derogatory and despised nickname of Oni-Yamaoka, a reference to the hideous creature of legend. One day, he met his fate as his former victims took revenge on him. It drew the Entity’s attention and he was deemed worthy of becoming part of its world, joining the other killers there, but ironically under the very form he had been compared to in his former life.The Oni’s Power: Yamaoka’s WrathThe desire to destroy weaker bloodlines shaped into a literal force. The Oni absorbs blood orbs left by injured Survivors. Once he’s collected enough orbs of blood, The Oni enters BLOOD FURY mode. Once active, The Oni will sheathe his katana and switch to his devastating kanabō. Blood Fury also grants The Oni access to powerful abilities:  - DEMON DASH allows The Oni to cover large distances quickly, closing the gap between him and his victims.   - DEMON STRIKE extends the range of The Oni’s attacks, and immediately puts Survivors into the dying state.The Oni comes with 3 new perks.Zanshin Tactics“See what others cannot see.” The auras of all nearby pallets and vault locations are revealed to The Oni. Zanshin Tactics briefly deactivates any time The Oni hits a Survivor.Blood Echo“Make them suffer.” When a Survivor is hooked, all injured Survivors suffer from the Hemorrhage status effect and the Exhausted status effect for a short time.Nemesis“Know your enemy.” A Survivor who blinds or stuns The Oni becomes the Obsession. Anytime a new Survivor becomes the Obsession, they become Oblivious to The Oni’s presence for a short duration, and their aura is briefly revealed.Quick, daring and superstitious, Yui Kimura was one of the youngest motorcyclists to break records in unsanctioned street races as well as the very prestigious Moto Grand Prix of Japan. Breaking with tradition and against her parents’ wishes, she left her home to pursue her dreams of racing and led a gang helping women in troubled situations. Until she found herself roped into another endless race where crossing the finish line was a matter of life and death.Yui comes with 3 new perks.Lucky Break“Leave no trace.” Any time you are injured, Lucky Break activates. You won’t leave any trails of blood for a limited amount of time. Once the full duration has elapsed, Lucky Break is permanently deactivated for the remainder of the trial.Any Means Necessary“Use your environment to your advantage.” Reset dropped pallets to their upright position. Using this perk incurs a lengthy cooldown.Breakout“Inspire hope in your allies.” When you are near a carried Survivor, you move faster, which, in turn, motivates the carried Survivor to wiggle faster.New Map: The Sanctum of WrathOnce opulent and well-tended by priests, this shrine was abandoned for reasons unknown. Paths that once welcomed weary travelers had become thick with vegetation... growing damp and unrestrained. A stranger shuddered with rage as he stepped into the area. Unable to restrain himself, he unleashed his might on the statue atop the shrine. Even after he left, a rot seemed to pervade the air.Exclusive Items for YuiThe Cursed Legacy Chapter includes an exclusive item: Yui’s Pink Striped Top, only available as part of the DLC. Please note that this item cannot be purchased separately.\",\n",

You can manipulate the ball to get the perfect angle and use your character's special moves to surprise them. But every strike speeds up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high speeds the tables are quickly turned. You can play locally with friends and foes, by yourself in the singleplayer modes or battle it out online!FeaturingUp to 4 players: Play locally AND online with up to 4 players.Easy to pick up, hard to master gameplay: Start off simply hitting the ball faster and faster back and forth. Improve by learning how to use Smashes, Bunts and Special Abilities to your advantage. Then go further beyond with parries and countering with throws ending with the pure psychological goodness: taunts. Tons of unlockable extras and secrets: Unlock characters and their outfits as you play. New modes and stages are in there too and even the soundtrack can be unlocked to play at leisure. Play on your own: Step up to the plate by yourself and beat a series of opponents in the Arcade Mode to reach the beat-blasting bossfight. Then check out the event-based Story Mode that has you playing all sides of the going-downs in Shine City.Modes and options:Pick your preferred style of play like with HP, one-shot kill or points. And then there are game modes like Strikers, using goals, and something called Lethal Volley... Wicked Tracks: A Breakbeat, Hip-Hop and House soundtrack featuring the likes of Hideki Naganuma, Frank Klepacki, Pixelord, Bignic and of course Klaus Veen.Lethal League Blaze is the sequel to the popular projectile-fighting game Lethal League known for it's ridiculous speeds and hitstun, the original game was intense to watch and intenser to play.

Purchasing the add-on will unlock its new Killer, new Survivor, and an exclusive item for the survivor.The Chains of Hate Chapter includes a new map, the Dead Dawg Saloon, in the ghost town of Glenvale. The Deathslinger, a former bounty hunter with a chip on his shoulder is the new Killer. Following the massacre of those who had betrayed him at Hellshire Penitentiary, The Deathslinger was lured into the Realm of the Entity where he now uses his unique invention—a rifle that fires a chain—to round up survivors for The Entity. The new survivor is Zarina Kassir, a modern day cowboy  using her camera and filmmaking skills to help those who cannot help themselves.  As she investigated the circumstances around the  ‘Mad Mick Massacre’ at Hellshire prison, she unravelled more than she bargained for. The DeathslingerA brilliant and fiery-tempered engineer, Caleb Quinn made a career out of revenge. When his wealthy employer, Henry Bayshore, stole the patents to his inventions, he broke into a violent, bloody rage. For fifteen years, Caleb languished in Hellshire Penitentiary, paying for his crimes. While doing his time, the warden asked him for a favor—fill the private prison with inmates. In return, the warden would use his political connections to imprison Bayshore for life. Caleb agreed. He returned to his workshop and created a pressure-based spear gun that allowed him to capture fugitives alive. With a gang of released inmates in his employ, Caleb hunted the countryside as a brutally efficient bounty hunter. But for all he did, he was just a pawn in a rich man's game. The warden betrayed him, selling Hellshire Penitentiary to Bayshore. In a fury, Caleb stormed Hellshire with his gang, killing anyone who stood in his way. The massacre ended with Bayshore and the warden bloody and dying, left for the inmates to finish off.The Deathslinger’s Power: The RedeemerThe Deathslinger’s ingenuity affords him the ability to reel in bounties with a unique invention—a heavily modified, hybrid rifle that replaces conventional ammunition with a razor-sharp spear affixed to a chain.Press and hold the Power button to aim down sights. Press the Attack button to shoot a spear that can lodge itself in a Survivor, allowing them to be reeled in towards The Deathslinger against their will. - REEL: While a Survivor is speared by The Redeemer, press and hold the Power button to reel them in towards you. Survivors may struggle against the chain or use the environment to pressure the chain to break. Doing so will result in briefly stunning The Deathslinger as well as putting The Survivor in the injured state and applying the Deep Wound status effect. Using a basic attack while a Survivor is speared will break the chain without applying a penalty to either The Deathslinger or The Survivor. Successfully hitting a Survivor with a basic attack while they are speared and healthy will also apply the Deep Wound status effect. - RELOAD: The Redeemer must be reloaded after every shot, before it may be fired again. Press and hold the Active Ability button to reload The Redeemer.The Deathslinger comes with 3 new perks.Gearhead After hitting a Survivor 2 times with your basic attack, Gearhead activates for a short duration. Each time a Survivor completes a Good Skill Check while repairing, the generator will be revealed by a yellow aura for as long as it is being repaired.Dead Man’s SwitchYou become obsessed with one Survivor. After hooking the Obsession, Dead Man’s Switch activates for a short duration. While activated, any Survivor that stops repairing a generator before it is fully repaired causes The Entity to block the generator until Dead Man’s Switch's effect ends. Affected generators are highlighted by a white aura.Hex: RetributionAny Survivor who cleanses a Dull Totem will briefly suffer from the Oblivious status effect. If any Hex Totem is cleansed, including this one, the auras of all Survivors are revealed for a short time.A daring, modern, workaholic filmmaker, Zarina strove to reveal the truth. Growing up in a Lebanese household in Brooklyn, she struggled with two unique cultural identities. With time she learned to embrace the different layers of her identity and roots and borrowed her father’s digital camera to interview members of her community in Bay Ridge. Posting her content online, she slowly built a loyal following.The sudden death of her father sent a shockwave of anger and pain that left Zarina in pieces. She became obsessed with his murderer—Clark Stevenson—his gang “IR-28,” and his short prison sentence. With the last of her inheritance she bought a new camera and a plane ticket to Nebraska and bribed the warden at Hellshire Penitentiary to let her interview Clark. Filming their first meeting, she asked him about his gang and his violent tendencies. Clark refused to talk; but in the weeks that followed, she used her research to push his buttons and finally got a confession of a pre-meditated crime. Zarina’s film became a tribute to her father and the trail of blood left by gang violence.Inspired by Hellshire’s “Mad Mick Massacre” story, her next project was based on the Irish outlaw who had heartlessly slaughtered the warden and his guards. Joining the historical walking tour, she infiltrated the prison and reached Mick’s dilapidated cell; but venturing inside, Zarina found more than she’d bargained for.Zarina comes with 3 new perks.Off The RecordOnce you are unhooked or escape from the hook, this perk activates for a moment. While the perk is active, your aura will not be shown to The Killer and grunts of pain caused by injuries are silenced.Red HerringOnce you’ve started repairing a generator, it will be highlighted with a yellow aura only visible to you. The generator stays highlighted until you fully repair it, repair a new generator, or enter a locker. Entering a locker will trigger a loud noise indicator from the generator that is only visible to the Killer and incurs a lengthy cooldown.For The PeopleFor the People is only active while at full health. Press the Active Ability button when healing another Survivor without a med kit to instantly heal them from dying to injured, or from injured to healthy. You become injured and receive the Broken status effect for a duration. You become the Obsession. Equipping this perk reduces the odds of you becoming the Obsession at the start of the trial.New Map: Dead Dawg SaloonAn early settlement on the unforgiving frontier, the outpost of Glenvale was snuffed out in a ruthless, bloody gang war. Responding to the abduction of five brothers-in-arms, the Hellshire Gang stormed in with six-shooters and dynamite. What began as a standoff with the Mason Kelly Gang quickly broke down into a chaotic war zone. Guns fired indiscriminately in a desperate bid for self-preservation, cutting through gang members and civilians alike.When the dust settled, the dead outnumbered the living. The hostages were discovered to have been long killed, their bodies disemboweled, guts strewn across town. In a silent rage, the few surviving Hellshire members rounded up their injured enemies and finished them in the same gruesome manner. By nightfall, only the crows remained, feasting glutinously upon their victory.Exclusive Items for ZarinaThe Chains Of hate Chapter includes an exclusive item: Zarina’s Leather Jacket, only available as part of the DLC. Please note that this item cannot be purchased separately.\",\n",

Though each is versatile and unique, both civilizations bring new challengers to the religious game. Indonesia is a strong coastal civilization with potential for a huge Jong-powered navy, and the Khmer thrive in their populous riverside cities. Both of these civilizations come into play in the new “Path to Nirvana” scenario, where you compete to have the most followers of your religion on a unique Southeast Asia map.Includes the Khmer civilization with Jayavarman VII, the Domrey unique unit, and the Prasat unique improvement.Civ Unique Ability: The “Grand Barays” ability gives Khmer additional food when Farms are built next to Aqueducts, and Aqueducts provide both Faith and an Amenity. Leader Unique Ability: Jayavarman’s “Monasteries of the King” ability lets Khmer grab adjacent territory as well as Food and Housing when Holy Sites are built on a river. Unique Unit: The Domrey, a ballista mounted on an elephant, is stronger than a Catapult, can move and shoot on the same turn, and exerts Zone of Control. Unique Building: The Prasat replaces the Temple and provides a Relic Great Work slot. Missionaries that are produced here gain a new attribute when killed in religious combat: they generate a Relic.Also includes the Indonesian civilization with Dyah Gitarja, the Jong unique unit, and the Kampung unique improvement:Civ Unique Ability: With the “Great Nusantara” ability, Coastal Tiles provide Indonesia with minor adjacency bonuses for certain districts and Entertainment Complexes give an extra Amenity if they are adjacent to a non-lake Coastal Tile.Leader Unique Ability: Gitarja has the “Exalted Goddess of the Three Worlds” ability, granting bonus Faith to coastal cities and allowing her to purchase Naval units with Faith at a discount, as well as eliminating movement cost for Religious unit to embark or disembark.Unique Unit: Indonesia’s unique unit is the Jong, which replaces the Frigate. It is faster, gains extra combat power if it’s in a formation, and all of the units in its formation gain its movement speed. Unique Improvement: The Kampung provides Housing, Production and Food for each adjacent Fishing Boat, and can be improved through further tech research later in the game. New “Path to Nirvana” Scenario:The lands around the Indian Ocean flourish with many religions and many people. Heaven has chosen you to bring the light to all these lands. Is your faith up to the challenge? In this 50 turn scenario, compete to have the most followers of your religion, the most faith per turn, and the most foreign cities following your religion.New Wonder:Angkor Wat: The largest religious monument in the world returns to Civilization! This temple must be built adjacent to an Aqueduct and provides Faith, plus it adds Housing and a Citizen to every one of the owner’s cities when built.New Natural Wonder:Ha Long Bay: This breathtaking bay was designated one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2012, and provides Food, Production, and Culture, in addition to providing a large combat bonus to naval units in its tiles.New Map:Spread your empire through Southeast Asia in this new map, with a True Start and random location option.',\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"Beasts of Bermuda is a multiplayer game hosting large servers in which the player is a dinosaur or other prehistoric creature. A player can take the role of flyers, swimmers, herbivores, carnivores, and semi-aquatic creatures that fulfill different niches in the ecosystem. No matter what the player chooses to be, the objective of the game is to survive and grow up on the islands of Bermuda by using their particular creature's abilities. Predation from other players as well as intense environmental events are the antagonistic forces in the game the player must survive against.There are currently three game modes in Beasts of Bermuda.  The first is our Life Cycle mode of gameplay.  The player selects a creature of choice and spawns into the world as a juvenile of that species.  They must survive and gradually grow larger over time.  As growth accumulates, they also earn talents, which can be spent to enhance different aspects of your creature's capabilities.  The second is Free Roam, which allows the player to instantly spawn as an adult with a fixed number of talent points.  Death has little consequence, as there are no growth mechanics, or other mechanics that reward the player for staying alive.The third game mode is Combat.  This mode pits players against one another with small maps, close spawns, and mechanics designed to reward conflict.  The player can accrue more talent points by killing other players and stealing their points.\",\n",

Introducing two rival Legendary Lords from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, each with their own objectives, mechanics, units and playstyle, for use in both the Eye of the Vortex and Mortal Empires campaigns, and custom/multiplayer battles.Two powerful new Legendary Lords with new quest-chains, legendary items and skills treesPlay as Clan Skryre (Skaven) or the Cult of Sotek (Lizardmen) with unique new campaign mechanicsTwo new additional Lord typesNine new battlefield units and variants including the bullet-spewing Ratling Gun Weapon Teams and the fearsome RipperdactylsUnleash ultimate devastation with the Clan Skryre Doomrocket, or summon an aspect of the very serpent god himself into battle with the Invocation of Sotek!New Regiments of Renown to unlock, recruit and fieldBackgroundThe great serpent-god Sotek may sleep, but Tehenauin – his most devoted prophet – does not. The time has come for the foul Skaven to pay the butcher’s bill for their plague-spreading acts, and pay they will – with their very lives! Tehenauin marshals his fellow Red-Crested Skinks: there will be a sacrifice. A vast, crimson sacrifice. Only when the temple-city altars are drenched with Skaven blood will the serpent god become manifest and enact his divine wrath…  But the Skaven do not sit idly by while Tehenauin plans his crusade. Scenting great Warpstone deposits in the jungles of Lustria, the arch Warlock-Engineer Ikit Claw has claimed The Star Tower in the name of Clan Skryre: a staging-post from which to delve deep into the continental interior. With the Forbidden Workshop at his disposal, Ikit Claw will bend the raw stuff of chaos to his twisted designs, forging ever-more ingenious and cataclysmic weapons… and placing the Warlock-Engineer on a collision course with the Prophet of Sotek!New Legendary Lords and FactionsIkit Claw, the Warlock Engineer (Skaven, Clan Skryre)Ikit Claw – like all of Skavenkind – is naturally suspicious, untrusting, untrustworthy and treacherous. His aptitude for science and invention is unrivalled, but as well as being the greatest Skaven Warlock Engineer of all time, Ikit Claw has also developed an awesome command of the Winds of Magic. His exceptional scientific knowledge and magical powers have made him indispensable to the Council of Thirteen. In his quest for destruction, Ikit seeks to realise his grandest design – the mighty Doomsphere – and he will stop at nothing to unleash it upon the world…Clan Skryre brings several unique faction features and mechanics to Total War: WARHAMMER II:Clan Skryre Forbidden WorkshopWith access to the infamous Forbidden Workshop, Clan Skryre players can spend resources to upgrade various units such as Doomwheels, Doom-flayers and Weapons Teams with powerful new stat-boosts and attributes. As the player upgrades in each category, they will unlock further ancillaries and, eventually, new regiments of renown unique to the Forbidden workshop.Workshop progress requires food and Warp Fuel, a new resource gathered after battles. New research tiers in the Workshop may be unlocked by completing unique missions. But the deadliest invention by far that the Workshop offers is the Warpstorm Doomrocket. Warpstorm DoomrocketsDoomrockets are outlandishly powerful weapons, deployed in battle as an Army Ability. They are crafted in the Forbidden Workshop, and can be stockpiled for use, though only one Doomrocket from the stockpile may be launched per battle. Perhaps the most powerful weapon wielded by any of the Races of WARHAMMER II, a single Doomrocket is capable of wiping out multiple units in a single strike, sending dust and debris skywards in an incinerating mushroom-cloud! DoomsphereWhile the Under-Empire is a feature newly-available to Skaven factions (see the Doomsayer Update Notes for more details), only Clan Skryre can build the Doomsphere within the Under-Cities they establish. This immense Warpstone bomb is powerful enough to completely destroy any settlement it is constructed below.Unique Lord – Warlock MasterThe Warlock Master is a caster Lord who uses the Lore of Ruin in battle. Warlock Masters have unique skills which grant further bonuses to Doom Flayers, Doomwheels and Weapons Teams. They may be upgraded to ride a Doom Flayer or Doomwheel in battle.Unique UnitsRatling Gun Weapons Team: Specialist anti-infantry gun teams bearing the rotating, rapid-fire Ratling Gun.

Regiments of RenownThese unique, elite variants are unlocked for recruitment as Ikit Claw and his Lords level up.Ikit's Zzzzap-Zzzzap!

As he led a migration out of the defiled city of Chaqua where the disease began, he prophesised the coming of the Serpent-God and rallied the surviving population of Lizardmen to join his counterattack. As Sotek’s cult grew, so too did the Prophet’s following, and for many years Tehenhauin led his apostles to many victories, slaughtering countless captives as sacrificial offerings in the hope that their spilt blood would bring forth the Serpent-God himself.The Cult of Sotek faction brings two new campaign mechanics to Total War: WARHAMMER II:Prophecy of SotekTehenauin believes that with sufficient sacrifices, the serpent-god may yet return, bringing salvation to the Lizardmen and the extermination of the Skaven. Tehenauin will be issued with a series of unique missions, the completion of which grants access to new forms of sacrifice. When performed, these reward Tehenauin with unique banners, followers, powerful temporary effects, Regiments of Renown and more.Sacrifices to SotekAs Tehenauin and his forces win battles against non-Lizardmen armies, they may choose to mark any post-battle captives as Sacrificial Offerings. As the offerings build, they may be spent on performing the sacrifices accessed by the Prophecy of Sotek missions.The ultimate sacrifice: Invocation of SotekThe highest level of sacrifice grants Tehenauin the ability to evoke Sotek himself, manifesting an aspect of the serpent-god in battle to deal devastating damage to his foes.Unique Lord: Red-Crested Skink ChiefRed-Crested Skink Chiefs are powerful melee-focussed Lords capable of leading armies, with their own unique skills tree.

The robots\\' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you\\'re allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn\\'t right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren\\'t in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!Can you survive five nights at Freddy\\'s?\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com This game was created using Clickteam Fusion!',\n",

Sensing the potential of this Daemonic entity, the Nightlord of Clan Eshin has dispatched his most trusted assassin, Deathmaster Snikch, to track down the Daemon and uncover its true power.Malus Darkblade (Hag Graef)Unique faction mechanicsPossessionIn order to counteract his possession by Tz’arkan, Malus must continually drink an elixir that slows the Daemon’s influence over his mind. While the elixir is costly to consume, his master Malekith will gladly provide him with the recipe, but only if he helps him in his bid to control the Vortex. Despite the obvious danger in allowing the Drinker of Worlds to take control of his mind, there are situations in battle when Malus might benefit from letting the possession overcome him momentarily; greatly amplifying even his legendary viciousness. However, managing such an addiction to seemingly endless power, confronts Malus with desperate challenges throughout his campaign, as he seeks to wrestle back control of his very soul.   Darkblade’s ExpeditionMalus starts the game in control of the mighty city of Hag Graef, while also in command of an expedition force supported by a Black Ark, on the other side of the world.In the opening stages of this campaign, the player is faced with a dilemma to either retain control of Hag Graef or give up the city in return for a hefty sum.With an offer Darkblade will find difficult to refuse, you’ll need to choose between two distinct campaign starts. Juggling the machinations Tz’arkan’s WhispersMalus Darkblade is the embodiment of hate and ruthlessness, qualities spurred by the evil brutality of the Daemon Tz’arkan. As Malus struggles in a constant inner-fight with the Daemon, it will attempt to influence him to perform acts of unthinkable slaughter and cruelty. As part of a new mission system, Malus can follow the Daemon’s dark whispers in return for unique and powerful rewards in the form of items, followers and other treasures. New units and charactersMalus Darkblade (Legendary Lord)In battle, Malus is a heavily armoured close-quarters combatant who excels at dealing armour piercing damage thanks to his powerful Warpsword of Khaine. He rides a ferocious Cold One, called Spite, into battle and instils fear upon his enemies, making him a terrifying opponent on the battlefield. Malus has the unique yet costly ability to transform into the Daemon Tz’arkan, the Drinker of Worlds.This ability refills his health, augments his stats and significantly alters his abilities in battle.High Beastmaster (Lord)The Dark Elves have long been experts at bending beasts and animals to their will, and the High Beastmasters are those that show even greater talent and aptitude. In particular, Beastmasters have considerable anti-large capabilities, making them a powerful tool when facing enemies that bring numberous large units into battle. Master (Hero)Dark Elf Masters are the lesser nobles of Dark Elf society. Adept with both spear and shield, these Heroes are capable of inflicting great damage to large targets, but are also capable of soaking up the most gruesome of blows thanks to their high melee defence and Guardian ability which protects nearby characters. Scourgerunner ChariotQuick and deadly, these war machines tear across the battlefield looking to hunt down new prey to kill or enslave. Equipped with powerful harpoons, they are a dedicated monster-hunting unit, capable of bringing down even the mightiest of beasts. Bloodwrack MedusaBound in pain-wracked serpentine bodies, the Bloodwrack Medusa is a terrifying sight to behold on the battlefield. These writhing, horrid monsters are best positioned behind the front line to maximise their powerful ranged attacks to decimate foes. However,  they can match their ranged skill with ruthless melee capabilities, granting them a useful hybrid role while also causing fear and terror to enemy units. Bloodwrack ShrinePropelled by Dark Magic, the Bloodwrack Shrine grinds along the battlefield, inspiring allies and demoralising foes with its passive Aura of Agony and Aura of Ardour abilities. From her elevated position, the Medusa riding it has a far greater vantage point from which to cast her deadly gaze.The Siren of Red Ruin (Bloodwrack Medusa – Regiment of Renown)The Siren of Red Ruin is fear incarnate. This unique Medusa can call upon a damaging area-of-effect ability which tears apart enemy units in a radius around her, making for an extremely dangerous foe in close-combat. Ravagers of Rakarth (Scorgerunner Chariot – Regiment of Renown)The Ravagers of Rakarth are Clar Karond’s most elite Scourgerunner unit. Always thirsting for new quarry, this anti-large chariot is additionally armed with barbed nets that that slow enemy units in order to increase its killing potential.The Crows of Khaine (Harpies – Regiment of Renown)Harpies are always on the lookout for the next meal and the Crows of Khaine are the most ravenous. They provide regeneration abilities in exchange for damage dealt, increasing their survivability and causing terror in enemy units as they guzzle down the entrails of their victims.Deathmaster SnikchUnique faction mechanicsShadowy DealingsDeathmaster Snikch and his agents are the most feared secret operatives in the world, capable of subterfuge actions that few others possess. Using any of their Eshin characters, Clan Eshin can perform numerous Shadowy Dealing actions against their rivals on the campaign map, with 100% success. Actions have a wide range of outcomes including the simple theft of items or money, all the way to spying, inciting rebellions, and assassination,. The Deathmaster himself is even able to burn down entire cities!Greater Clan ContractsSkavendom’s unseen leaders are forever seeking to disrupt and backstab each other on the Council of Thirteen. When a problem arises that needs serious attention, the Greater Clans approach Clan Eshin to do their dirty work. These Clan Contracts allow Clan Eshin to receive money, food and increased reputation with the issuing clans, thus granting bonuses and reducing the cost of the Greater Clans’ specialized units.New units and charactersDeathmaster Snikch (Legendary Lord)With unmatched stealth abilities and immense duelling prowess, Deathmaster Snikch excels at fighting other characters, especially when they are vulnerable and have already taken damage. Armed with his deadly Weeping Blades, he can instantly reduce a target’s armour by 50% on contact. Snikch also has the Vanguard Deployment and Stalk abilities, further cementing his role as the foremost Master Assassin of the Skaven.Master Assassin (Lord)Following in Snikch’s example, the Master Assassin excels at battling opposition characters in close combat but can also rely on their ranged shuriken attack to take enemies out from a distance. Their wide range of abilities such as Vanguard Deployment, Stalk and Concealment Bombs make them lethal ambush commanders to unleash upon your enemy. Eshin Sorcerer (Hero)Masters in the art of silent death, Eshin Sorcerers use the Lore of Stealth to support their allies from the rear of the battlefield. This new magic lore has a focus on sneakiness and controlling the battlefield, meaning they can dictate the tempo and flow of the battle to their advantage. Eshin TriadsOnly the most devout apprentice assassins ascend to the rank of Triad. Well-drilled and deadly, these warriors are a versatile alternative to their Clanrat and Stormvermin brethren and are best utilised behind the front ranks, excelling at exploiting gaps and weaknesses in the enemy lines. Whilst their armor isn’t the strongest, they make up for it with their Vanguard Deployment and Stalk abilities. Capabilities which enhance their sneakiness on the battlefield.  Poisoned-Wind Mortar These mobile, rat-portable mortars are packed with a payload of poisoned wind-globes which can be fired at a much greater distance than their Globadier equivalents. Capable of causing the enemy damage over time as they choke on the deadly Warpstone gas, this unit excels at damaging a wide swathe of the enemy at once.Warp-Grinder Weapon TeamsDrilling into the ground and their enemies alike, the Warp-Grinder Weapon Teams rely upon powerful active abilities that create devastating effects on the battlefield. Once they’ve tied down their enemies with tremor effects, their drills can pierce the toughest of armours… provided the team can get within range. This unit can also destroy settlement walls, rending stone asunder with scant regard for friend or foe. The Avalanche Mortar (Death Globe Mortars – Regiment of Renown)These rare and infernal devices can fire special air-burst globes from great distances that explode in mid-air and inflict devastating armor-piercing damage upon all units unfortunate enough to be caught in their line of fire.Viskrin’s Death Squad (Death Runner – Regiment of Renown)Viskrin’s Death Squad are the elite among their rank and excel at acts of espionage. Lightly armoured but highly mobile, this unit is capable of outputting great amounts of armour piercing damage with their trusty weeping blades as well as making use of their elite combat agility in order to become even harder for the enemy to hit in return.Ishka’s Triads (Eshin Triads – Regiment of Renown) Ishka’s Triads follow the teachings of Ishka Fastclaw, who was once the Nightlord of Clan Eshin. Exhibiting deadly anti-large capabilities, they have the ability to summon a decoy of themselves upon the battlefield, making them ideal for deceiving the enemy while both attacking and retreating.

       "  'full_bio': 'In GROUND BRANCH, you will play as the elite paramilitary arm of the CIA\\'s Special Activities Center/Special Operations Group (SAC/SOG) and lead other special operations forces through challenging deniable ops all over the globe. With deliberate, calculated and unforgiving gameplay, GROUND BRANCH aims to be the true rebirth of the tactical realism genre of the late \\'90s and early 2000s. Powered by Epic\\'s Unreal Engine 4, GB puts the \"tactical\" back in \"tactical shooter\"—no compromises.▶ TRUE FIRST PERSONGROUND BRANCH\\'s unique True First-Person System improves world immersion and awareness of your surroundings, providing zero disconnect between your view and your character\\'s physical presence in the environment. See your foot sticking out of cover? Better tuck it in—enemies may be able to see it (and shoot it) too, but only if their line of sight and muzzle are verifiably unobstructed. Cameras are placed at the character\\'s eyes and bullets originate from the weapon\\'s muzzle. In GROUND BRANCH, what you see is what you get.A minimal HUD with multiple optional elements ensures that vital information is available, but never a constant obstacle to either immersion or your field of view.▶ UNPRECEDENTED CUSTOMIZATIONSay goodbye to pre-defined kits and fully customize your character and gear from basic appearance and outfit to in-depth vest and weapon platform customization, down to individual pouch and attachment placement. What you bring to your mission is determined only by your loadout choice, with realistic consequences: With the upcoming encumbrance and stamina system, too much equipment will impact your character\\'s speed and performance; place a scope too forward on the rail and your sight picture will be too small; bring a long rifle into CQB and weapon collision may prove a hindrance.Forget unlocks, microtransactions and loot boxes. Ground Branch operators get all the right tools for the job straight away—courtesy of the Agency.▶ OPERATE, COOPERATEWhether in 8-player co-op or 8v8 adversarial game modes, GROUND BRANCH\\'s unforgiving gameplay makes careful and calculated teamwork essential. Gather your teammates and practice in full-featured training areas, including shooting ranges with dynamic targets and customizable killhouses. Integrated VOIP with both 3D positional voice and radio ensures full communication capabilities with no need for third-party software. Text chat and pre-recorded voice messages (commo rose-style) also available for the mic-less and the shy.Prefer single-player? Missions with friendly A.I. and a full command system are fully planned.▶ BE IN FULL CONTROLIn the tactical shooter realm, movement and weapon handling are king. Take full control of your character with standing, crouching and (soon!) prone stances—each with multiple movement speeds—as well as unique weapon postures (including low- and high-ready), leaning and stepping out, free-look (head movement independent from aim), customizable and optional free-aim (dead zone), dedicated mouse sensitivity sliders for point-shooting/unmagnified/magnified aiming, and all-around highly configurable key bindings.You can also choose between speed reloads (drop magazine) and tactical reloads (retain current magazine) on the fly.▶ ADDITIONAL FEATURES(both working/in-process—marked √—and planned)MissionsGROUND BRANCH\\'s unique \"campaign\" format will deliver smaller, more localized sets of missions based around global hotspots, with a centralized intelligence interface to monitor them and receive new mission orders over time. The choices you make along the way may affect future engagements.√ Based on unique environments all over the world, the non-linear mission and map designs offer multiple entry points and open-ended outcomes.√ Enemies are spawned at mission start, with a degree of randomization to quantity and location. No \"monster closets\" or magic enemy spawns based on player location or mission progress.Multiplayer√ Ready Room: A physical multiplayer lobby where you can plan your approach, see your teammates\\' loadouts, test weapon configurations on a firing range and jointly select insertion points.√ Full—and free—dedicated server support. Host a server wherever you want!Create your own unit patches and attach them to your character\\'s sleeves and headgear.Full support for MP ladders.After-action review (AAR) following each mission/round.Server-side options.MiscellaneousFull mod support.√ No gear unlocks, hit markers, kill confirmations or score pop-ups.Weapon bracing/supporting.√ Varied arsenal: Multiple handguns, submachine guns, carbines, assault and battle rifles, machine guns, DMRs, sniper rifles and explosives to choose from, with selectable ammunition type (e.g. full metal jacket, hollow point or subsonic rounds, smoke grenade color etc.).√ Map variation: In addition to day and night versions as well as weather variation, maps have small details that can change between rounds, such as doors and windows that may be open, closed or blocked.√ Unlimited loadout save slots.√ Item sharing/dropping/pickups.√ Accurate ballistics with penetration, bullet drop and stopping power simulation.No regenerating health or health packs: Administer first aid to non-lethal injuries for reduced combat effectiveness. Location damage model: Expect visible injuries and consequences, such as limping, reduced arm function, and/or hits to stamina and accuracy. Players immobilized from a non-lethal injury can stay in the fight.Carry teammates to safety to administer first aid—or to safely recover their ammo, gear, cargo or body if they are no longer alive.Appropriate and realistic playable female characters.√ Partial controller support (configurable).',\n",

Explore Earth and our neighboring worlds in the Solar System, orbit a black hole in a galaxy billions of light-years away, or visit anything in between seamlessly, with no transitions.All of time and space are yours to explore – cruise between the stars at a million times the speed of light, and accelerate time to watch the orbital motions of a thousand worlds play out before your eyes. Every planet you encounter in your journey will feature procedural 3D terrain with detailed textures. Everything you see in the sky – stars and galaxies, planets and moons, asteroids and comets, black holes and neutron stars, star clusters and nebulae – are yours to explore at the press of a button.Spacecraft with Newtonian physics and pilot-assist autopilot features (in early development but fully usable) are yours to fly anywhere in the universe in the Flight Simulator mode. SpaceEngine is also very friendly for creators of mods and add-ons – create your own planets, star systems, even galaxies, import your own spacecraft models, create custom GUI skins, and more, all easily sharable with others.With SpaceEngine, the possibilities are limitless.SpaceEngine Planetarium capabilities:AstronomyAll types of celestial objects are represented: galaxies, nebulae, stars and star clusters, planets and moons, comets and asteroids. Known celestial objects are represented using data from catalogs: galaxies (NGC/IC), stars (HIPPARCOS), star clusters, nebulae, and planets (Solar System and known extrasolar planets). Regions of space not yet cataloged feature procedurally generated objects: galaxies, stars, star clusters, nebulae, and planetary systems.ControlsYou are free to move around the universe – travel seamlessly between any object and any distance, from surface to orbit to interstellar and intergalactic space. Moving through space is as easy as \"click and go\", as well as game-style free flight using the WASD keys or a gamepad. Also, time travel is possible: you can accelerate, decelerate, or reverse the flow of time, and jump to a specified date. Detailed interactive tutorials will familiarize you with the controls.GraphicsVolumetric 3D models of galaxies and nebulae with interstellar dust clouds, and 3D landscapes on planets and stars. For many Solar System bodies, actual data from space probes is used, with huge, high-resolution texture packs available as free DLC. For unmapped and procedural planets, the surface is generated procedurally using your computer\\'s GPU. Other features include realistic atmospheric scattering, eclipse shadows, animated auroras and comet tails, and physically-based light warping near black holes and neutron stars, with animated accretion disks and jets.PhysicsRealistic and physically-based generation of procedural objects (galaxies, star systems, planets) and their physical properties (mass, radius, temperature, atmospheric parameters, etc). The orbital motion of planets, moons, and stars in multiple-star systems are accurately calculated and displayed. Realistic space ship design concepts and physics: orbital motion, atmospheric flight model, and Alcubierre warp drive physics.Virtual realitySpaceEngine supports Oculus (via native library) and SteamVR (HTC Vive, Valve Index, WMR and other headsets). Support of VR controllers is partial: you can select objects with one controller and move around with the other one. Please note that VR support is still a work in progress, and new users should become familiar with the program in 2D before trying to use VR.SoundOriginal background music tracks made by many authors, with context-sensitive playback. Sound effects for planetary environments and space ships are in development.ToolsBuilt-in tutorials will help you start using the Planetarium. Search for celestial objects by name and search for the nearest star systems. Browse the cosmos using a scalable Universe map and planetary system chart. Saving, exporting, and importing of locations is supported, which can easily be shared between users. The program keeps an automatic journal of objects you have recently visited. Learn every detail about the objects you find using the built-in “Wiki” info system, with additional hand-written descriptions of many known objects. Display the orbital paths of celestial objects, labels and markers, constellations, and other informational tools.Multi-language supportCurrently SpaceEngine is available in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish, Croatian, Czech, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Catalan, Chinese, Japanese, Korean languages. Many new localizations are under development. Only localizations which are 100% complete are displayed on the Steam store page, but you can enable others in-game.ModdingSpaceEngine supports creating and importing user add-ons: catalogs, models and textures for deep space objects, planets, and space ships. Spacecraft models, representing both real and fictional designs – including from popular sci-fi franchises – are commonly imported and shared by the community on the Steam Workshop.',\n",

Valve\\'s debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named \"Best PC Game Ever\" by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide.NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player\\'s presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him.The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source®, Valve\\'s new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial \"muscles,\" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.Graphics: Source\\'s shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story® and Monster\\'s, Inc.®, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.',\n",

We absolutely still plan to deliver all the promised content, we just had to change the order of the updates and merge one with another.About the game:IT RUNS IN THE FAMILYChildren of Morta is an action RPG with a rogue-lite approach to character development, where you don’t play a single character - but a whole, extraordinary family of heroes. Hack’n’slash through hordes of enemies in procedurally generated dungeons, caves and lands and lead the family of Bergsons, with all their flaws and virtues, against the forthcoming Corruption.FEATURES:GAMEPLAYGameplay-wise it\\'s a unique mix of action-adventure RPG, rogue-lite and hack and slash game. By leveling up, you develop not only individual characters but also the entire family. There is no permadeath and you can change family members between the dungeon runs.STORYThe story takes place in a distant land but copes with themes and emotions common to all of us: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss... and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for. Ultimately, it\\'s about a family of heroes standing against the encroaching darkness.DUNGEON CRAWLINGAll the dungeons in the game are procedurally generated, which means their layout is different with each adventure. There can be from two to four levels of each dungeon, with a unique boss fight at the end. You can always get back to the previous dungeons to get extra XP or finish all the side quests.CHARACTERS & SKILLSRanged attacks, magic spells, blocks, stuns, healing, evasions and passive skills - it\\'s all there for you to discover, unlock and upgrade. You can choose from seven different family members, each one having unique skill sets. The father, John - a protective warrior with a sword and shield. The elder daughter Linda - a precise archer. Kevin, a quiet fighter equipped with deadly daggers. Lucy - a lively and bold fire mage. Mark - a mindful martial arts fighter. Joey - who smashes his enemies with a sledgehammer. And the latest addition to the family - Apan, a mighty healer and a firm defender in one.ART STYLEA combination of hand-painted pixel art and frame-by-frame animations partnered with modern lighting techniques come to life to create the beautifully dangerous world of Children of Morta!',\n",

This new expansion provides enhanced depth and replayability through the introduction of international trade and a focus on culture and diplomacy. Your influence around the world will be impacted by creating Great Works, choosing an ideology for your people and proposing global resolutions in the World Congress. As you move through the ages of history you will make critical decisions that will impact your relationship with other civilizations. Sid Meier’s Civilization V: Brave New World also introduces nine new civilizations, eight new wonders, two new scenarios, four new gameplay systems and dozens of new units, buildings and improvements offering an expanded variety of ways to build the most powerful empire in the world.FEATURESNew Culture Victory: Spread your culture across the globe, dominating all other cultures. Create masterpieces with Great Artists, Writers and Musicians that are placed in key buildings across your empire like Museums, Opera Houses, and even the Great Library. Use Archaeologists to investigate sites of ancient battles and city ruins for priceless cultural artifacts. Become the first civilization with a majority influence in all other civilizations to achieve a Culture Victory, becoming the envy of the world. New Policies and Ideologies: Enter the Industrial Age and choose the ideology of your people: Freedom, Order, or Autocracy. Each ideology grants access to increasingly powerful abilities, and serves the different victory conditions in unique ways. The choices you make will impact your relationships with other civilizations for the rest of the game.World Congress: The importance of diplomacy is intensified and city-state alliances are more important than ever. Change the diplomatic landscape through a new World Congress that votes on critical issues like implementing trade sanctions against rogue nations, limiting resource usage, designating host cities for the World Games, and the use of nuclear weapons.

The number of trade routes increases through the advancement of economics and technologies, the creation of wonders, and the unique abilities of your civilization.

New Wonders:This expansion set introduces eight new Wonders including the Parthenon, Broadway, the Globe Theater, and the Uffizi.Two New Scenarios:American Civil War: Fight the “War Between the States” from either the Union or Confederate side as you focus on the critical Eastern theatre of operations between the capital cities of Richmond and Washington.\\xa0 Scramble for Africa: The great colonial powers of the world are scrambling to explore the Dark Continent and extend their reach into its interior.

       "  'full_bio': \"About This ContentDemise of the Faithful is a brand-new Chapter for Dead by Daylight, which includes a new Killer, a Survivor and a Map. Purchasing the Demise of the Faithful DLC will unlock its new Killer, new Survivor, and an exclusive item for the new survivor.Embrace the immense unknown and surrender yourself to the vast inexplicable: that is the oath of the faithful. When surrounded by darkness, they look inward for a beacon of light to follow, trusting it will lead them to safety. But when their light is distorted by pride and ambition, how long will they err in the dark? Sold to a Babylonian temple as a child, she sought the means to repel the darkness she carried inside. She found solace in sacred rituals, where she felt safe and empowered. Faithful but proud, she began to rise in status and believed she was untouchable. But when a plague began to defile her body, she confronted her gods, realizing too late that they had no impact on her fate.Jane Romero was striving to become a powerful icon, a voice that would inspire and support those in need. She fought against powerful executives to send out her message about owning up to your insecurities. Every day she would share her beliefs and practices with thousands of avid followers. One evening, she was driving home after a particularly stressful live show, and feeling drained, she closed her eyes for a moment that had lasting consequences.The PlagueDevoted to the gods with unwavering faith, this former High Priestess of Babylon convinced hundreds to follow her lead. Hymns and amulets were created in her honor, praising her beauty and foresight. She gained influence during a time of despair, when a dark plague was gaining ground and rapidly spreading across Babylon. Her faith proved to be inconsequential against the disease, which she contracted. While she hid the blisters swelling from her neck, the sores crusting her lips, and the rancid smell of sick clinging to her skin, she continued to lead the prayers, hoping to appease the gods. But no ritual could save her. Growing desperate, she banished herself from Babylon with a small group of followers and traveled North. Her condition then took a turn for the worse, interrupting their journey, and they took refuge in a cold cave, where they met their end.The Plague’s Power: Vile PurgeThe former High Priestess of Babylon wanted to rise high enough to touch the gods. Just as she thought she was untouchable, she contracted a terrible affliction that she kept secret. Every day, she would perform rituals and cleanse her followers, hoping the god of pestilence and mayhem would forgive her. Her condition deteriorated as the plague overtook her body: her toes blackened, her neck mushroomed into cysts, and her throat gagged with blood vomit. The Plague uses her power, Vile Purge, to release a stream of vomit that infects her victims. A gauge controls the amount of time the Power lasts once launched. The Gauge starts empty. To fill it up, the player is required to charge his attack by holding down on the Power button. During the charging, The Plague suffers a speed movement penalty which ends when the power is released or when the charge reaches 100%. At that moment the movement speed is back to 100% of the base speed.The Plague comes with 3 new perks.Dark Devotion The display of your powers creates a whirlwind of panic that spreads throughout the land. You become obsessed with one survivor. Hitting the obsession to the injured state with your basic attack causes the obsession to emit a terror radius. During that time, your terror radius is reduced to 0. This effect can only be triggered once every 3 seconds. The obsession hears the terror radius they emit for the duration. The Killer can only be Obsessed with one survivor at a time. “And terror shall take hold of a defiant non-believer, who shall falsely announce my arrival.” (The Tablet of Adiris, 48.9)Infectious FrightThe cries of the unfaithful makes your heart leap, as you believe that a divine power causes their agony. Any Survivors who are within The Killer's terror radius while another Survivor is put into the dying state with a basic attack will yell and reveal their location to The Killer.“Horror overcomes the heart of infidels who cry at the feet of the fallen.” (Hymn of Praise, 11. 4) Corrupt InterventionYour prayers invoke a dark power that meddles with the Survivors’s chances of survival. The generators located furthest from you are blocked by The Entity at the start of the trial for a limited duration. Survivors cannot repair these generators during that time.“It shall be known across the land that the gods curse the unfaithful.” (The Tablet of Adiris, 3.7.) The Influential Talk Show HostDaughter of a famous actress whom she had never met, Jane was raised by her father, a struggling visual artist. Her parents had separated when she was still a baby. Growing up, she sought to emulate her mother’s powerful on-screen presence. She built herself from the ground up, auditioning for commercials, leading radio-interviews, and guest-starring in variety shows. Her authentic delivery and sharp ad-libs, however, cost her dearly. While she encountered failures along the way, she kept believing in her skills, and eventually got the opportunity to co-host a failing talk show. Live television meant long hours, a low salary, and no stability, but it also offered her a platform to broadcast her own values. She used the show to connect with her audience and deliver genuine material, often discussing her personal issues, gathering a loyal audience that broke records. Her success also generated an increasingly demanding schedule, which she managed all by herself. The growing pressure began to smother her self-confidence and one day she snapped, delivering a catastrophic live interview. That evening, she was driving to her father’s house when she closed her eyes to rest, and opened them moments later, in the realm of The Entity.Jane’s personal perks, Solidarity, Head On, and Poise allow her to support other Survivors, defend herself, and avoid leaving a trail for the Killer to follow. Jane Romero comes with 3 new perks.PoisedAchieving goals boosts your confidence. After a generator is completed, you leave no scratch marks for a limited duration.“Ok, stay calm. Don’t overthink it and just keep moving forward: you got this.” –Jane RomeroHead OnWhen your mind is set, there better be no one standing in your way. Allows to perform a rushed action to exit a locker and stun The Killer if standing within range. Head On cannot be used while Exhausted.  You do not recover from the Exhausted status effect while running. “People are remembered for the challenges they overcome. You can run away and forget what you’re capable of, or you can face your fears and remind the world who you are.” –Jane RomeroSolidaritySharing painful experiences has the power to heal. While injured, healing a Survivor also heals you.  “Showing up when things get rough, listening to people’s problems, and supporting those in need; that’s how you become stronger, because that’s how you grow.” –Jane RomeroExclusive Item for JaneThe Demise of the Faithful Chapter includes an exclusive item for Jane, her Floral Shirt, only available as part of the DLC. Please note that this item cannot be purchased separately. New Map: The Temple of PurgationThe half-forgotten, temple complex dedicated to the cleansing of the High Priestess’s followers. The vertiginous hypostyle hall was believed to hold the weight of the heavens. Stolen from the memories of The Plague, the temple was planted in the howling Red Forest, whose winds eroded its smooth edges. It now stands as a beacon of fear, visible from all cardinal points.\",\n",

This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn't even bear imagining.StorylineThis house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred.

Our workplace is filled with them; strangers beside us, five days a week. A distant familiarity grown from habit; the blanks filled with assumptions as we forget how little we know, until proven otherwise. The Ghost Face took full advantage of the fact. His entourage at the newspaper could have spotted that the Roseville murders led to him. There were clues: the days he missed work, the victims’ time of death, and the detailed articles he wrote citing sources he never shared. But his coworkers did not see.  The Ghost Face blended into the everyday.  No one thought the man seated on their left could be responsible for the murder of a dozen people. Until proven otherwise.In the end, The Ghost Face would have gotten away with it as he had before: he would have packed his bags when the investigation pointed in his direction, driven a few miles, and looked for another job. But this time he found a richer hunting ground…The Ghost FaceAt first glance, Jed Olsen was a kind and enthusiastic freelancer with experience at various small newspapers. He was hired at the Roseville Gazette, whose staff appreciated how easy-going he seemed. Olsen didn’t have to justify his erratic career path, which zigzagged between Utah and Philadelphia. He had a good attitude and a decent portfolio, which showed he’d covered serious news such as unsolved murders. Most importantly, he was ready to start right away.Five months later, the Roseville Murders began: victims ranging from young to old, stabbed to death in their homes. The whole staff was working the story. The number of victims surged as Olsen worked the story. To heighten the swelling panic in Roseville, Olsen produced the footage of a hooded figure breaking into a house at night. Olsen’s masked face, a white blur in the dark, stared at the camera for a second, before disappearing inside. “The Ghost Face Caught on Tape” was the title Olsen gave the article. He was proud of his work, enjoying how the whole town now feared a ghost story.When the investigation started to point in his direction, he left Roseville swiftly. He had written and collected a dozen of articles, all of which fed his legend. Finding a satisfying challenge next would be difficult, yet opportunity found him.  The Ghost Face’s Power: Night ShroudThe Ghost Face liked to stalk his victims. He’d follow them from the local bar, snapping pictures of them at home while looking for a way in. He could study the same victim for weeks, meticulously registering their habits. He'd return when the urge swelled inside him, too great to ignore. By then he knew exactly what to do. While the Night Shroud is active: The Ghost Face’s Terror Radius shrinks to nil. Under these conditions, The Ghost Face becomes Stealth, as long as he stays unseen from all Survivors. The Ghost Face can stalk Survivors to find their vulnerabilities, making them exposed for a limited time.The Ghost Face comes with 3 new perks.I’m All Ears When Survivors create a loud noise outside your Terror Radius, their aura is revealed for a limited time.Thrilling Tremors After picking up a Survivor, all Generators not being repaired by Survivors are blocked by The Entity and cannot be repaired for a limited time. Affected generators are highlighted by a white aura.  Furtive ChaseYou become obsessed with one Survivor. When your Obsession is hooked, the Perk receives a token. Each token decreases your Terror Radius during a chase. Next time a Survivor rescues someone from the hook, the rescuer becomes the Obsession.Exclusive Item for the GhostThe Ghost Face add-on includes two exclusive items for The Ghost face, the Monochrome Maniac body and Silvery Steel Tactical Knife weapon, only available as part of the DLC. Please note that this item cannot be purchased separately.\",\n",

Staying hyper-vigilant will get you far against these two malicious threats, eager to infiltrate your home. The last thing you want is to run the risk of getting caught off guard. You will accomplish this by walking around the immersive environment of Luna's home and making sure that windows are closed and the lights are on. Collect evidence, correctly file your reports, and survive this horror experience the next simulated 10 nights. If you can keep yourself from getting kidnapped, killed, or worse, you might finally be able to relax.

Introducing two rival Legendary Lords from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, each with their own objectives, mechanics, units and playstyle, for use in both the Eye of the Vortex and Mortal Empires campaigns, and custom/multiplayer battles.Two richly themed new Legendary Lords lead their own factions: Markus Wulfhart leads the Huntsmarshal’s Expedition (Empire), and Nakai The Wanderer leads the Spirit of the JungleEach Legendary Lord brings their own unique faction mechanics, quest-chains, legendary items, skill-trees and campaign narrativeDevastating new ranged units, mobile gunpowder batteries and fabled Hunter Heroes for the Huntsmarshal’s ExpeditionTowering new Dread Saurians, the largest beasts to walk the world of Total War: WARHAMMER, plus new Kroxigors, Razordons and Rites for Spirit of the JungleNew Regiments of Renown to unlock, recruit and fieldBackgroundFearless, charismatic, daring: these are but a few of the epithets bestowed upon Markus Wulfhart, the Huntsmarshal of Emperor Karl Franz. With his band of ruthless trackers, scouts, hunters and sharpshooters, who better to dispatch to the steaming jungles of Lustria, in order to plant the flag and further Imperial interests? And if some Big Game should wander into the crosshairs, why, all the better… But the jungle does not sleep. Nakai The Wanderer, revered Kroxigor of the first-spawning, is a living legend among the Lizardmen. Wandering the jungles of Lustria since the destruction of his home-city of Tlanxla during the Great Catastrophe, he follows where the Great Plan wills him. Now Lustria is at threat from usurpers once more. Nakai will rally the Sacred Kroxigors, and rouse the Dread Saurians from their ageless slumber – the Old Ones demand it!Markus Wulfhart (The Huntsmarshal’s Expedition)Unique faction mechanics:Emperor’s MandateAs Markus Wulfhart expands Imperial interests in Lustria, his stature in the eyes of the Emperor grows. As a result, he receives a broadening range of increasingly advanced Empire units to aid in his expedition. As new territory is captured, his building options also diversify. In the Eye of the Vortex campaign, Markus will ultimately face the Spirit of the Jungle himself, Nakai the Wanderer, to decide who holds dominion over the jungles of Lustria.Wulfhart’s campaign progress is measured by how effectively he fulfils the Emperor’s Mandate. Expansion, successful military operations and other campaign activities increase his acclaim, which is tracked on the Emperor’s Mandate bar.The Emperor’s Mandate also dictates the quality of units available to Wulfhart via the Imperial Supplies system, which dispatches better units for him to recruit from time to time. As the Mandate bar fills, he will also unlock bonuses to further improve these units, plus new recruitment buildings.In the Eye of the Vortex campaign, filling the Emperor’s Mandate bar will cause Nakai the Wanderer to issue a final, do-or-die challenge to Markus Wulfhart – a call to battle that will become the stuff of legend!HostilityThe lands beyond the Empire are inimical to man, and Wulfhart’s actions will not go unnoticed. While defeating the local inhabitants improves Wulfhart’s Imperial standing and increases his supply of fresh troops, it also enrages Lustria’s native denizens…Wulfhart’s Hostility rating reflects the current level of Lustria’s retaliation against his military activities. Aggressive activities, such as military actions and raiding, can raise Hostility through five levels. Conversely, a more passive approach to the campaign will cause Hostility to fall.Each Hostility level has a negative effect on Wulfhart’s campaign, but is also a measure of his aggression against the Lizardmen. As he ascends through the Hostility levels, reinforcements are dispatched more frequently via the Imperial Supplies system. The strength of these reinforcements is still dictated by the Emperor’s Mandate bar.When peak Hostility is reached, a Lizardmen task-force is dispatched with the aim of defeating Wulfhart. He will instantly receive an Imperial Supplies drop and will need to survive sustained assault for a number of turns before the hostility bar resets.Wulfhart’s HuntersScattered throughout Lustria are four of the finest Hunters that ever lived. Wulfhart may attempt to track them down and acquire their services to aid in the expedition’s success, and subsequently developing each Hunter’s unique attributes and learning the tales of their past deeds.Wulfhart can search for the four Hunters in the Jungles of Lustria by completing special missions. The Hunters each have bespoke stories which are uncovered through unique missions. Completing these missions will reward them with new traits and powerful abilities.The Hunters are not required to complete Wulfhart's narrative Vortex campaign, but bring major benefits to the Huntsmarshal’s Expedition.Jorek Grimm is a brilliant Master Engineer. Shunned for his eccentric ideas, he has struck out alone to seek his fortune in Lustria…Rodrik L'Anguille was once a renowned Paladin. Disgraced and exiled however, he is haunted by a past he cannot escape…Hertwig Van Hal, a skilled physician and Witch Hunter, has travelled far from home on his quest for ultimate vengeance…Kalara of Wydrioth, the eminent Waystalker, has traded the forests of Avelorn for the jungles of Lustria in pursuit of redemption…New units and characters:Markus WulfhartIn battle, Wulfhart is a ranged combatant with a powerful armour-piercing bow which deals bonus damage to large targets. Coupled with Vanguard Deployment, Stalk, a 360-degree fire-arc and immune to psychology, he has a well-deserved reputation as the ultimate monster hunter.In keeping with his reputation, Markus Wulfhart has a significant ambush defence and ambush success chance, and a large upkeep reduction to Huntsmen and Archers in his army. Huntsman General (Lord)Following Wulfhart’s example, his Huntsman Generals have Vanguard Deployment, Stalk, a 360-degree fire-arc are immune to psychology, and deal bonus damage against large targets. Their Fire Arrow capabilities mean they synergise well with Bright Wizards, and they grant reload-rate bonuses to other Imperial missile units.  ArchersThe backbone of Wulfhart’s hunting-parties, these Imperial archers are inexpensive, plentiful, quick to fire, and are great at soaking enemy formations with ranged damage. Their loose formation enables them to trade fire with other ranged units at a profit. Deathjacks (Archers – Regiments of Renown)These elite archers also have Stalk, Snipe and Vanguard Deployment, enabling them to strike fast, strike first, and remain hidden from view. If well-screened, they can continue to fire without fear of discovery or ranged retaliation. Huntsmen:Only the finest archers ascend to the rank of Huntsmen. Well-drilled and versatile, they have Vanguard Deployment and Stalk, can fire while moving, have a greater range than standard Archers, enjoy a good degree of accuracy, and deal bonus damage to large targets. White Wolves (Huntsmen – Regiment of Renown)Few face the White Wolves and live to tell of it. These elite Huntsmen match their bow-skills with ruthless melee capabilities, granting them a useful hybrid role. Alongside their Hunter attributes, they also Encourage nearby friendlies and are Immune to Psychology.   War WagonThese mobile armoured wagons are packed with six riflemen, each armed with an armour-piercing Outrider rifle. Slower than standard missile cavalry but far more resilient, they can fire while moving and in all directions, and reposition to place their fusillades precisely where required. In a pinch, they can also be used as chariots and charged into lighter or weakened enemy units. War Wagon (Mortar)These mobile artillery pieces may carry less ammo than standard mortars, but more than make up for it by being able to stay one step ahead of melee combatants, repositioning when threatened to set up a new base-of-fire and bombard the foe afresh.  The Black Lions (War Wagon - Helblaster Volley Gun – Regiment of Renown)The ultimate unit in The Expedition’s armoury, The Black Lion is a devastating mobile light artillery piece. While shorter ranged than a standard Helblaster Volley Gun, it can pump rounds into approaching troops until the last second, then reposition to avoid getting caught in melee. Nakai the Wanderer (Spirit of the Jungle)Unique faction mechanics:New Horde mechanicsNakai’s faction, the Spirit of the Jungle, offers a unique variation on Horde gameplay. Each army in his faction, when placed in the Encampment stance, may develop its settlement infrastructure much as a standard settlement would. That infrastructure is preserved when the horde moves off, and may be further developed during future periods of Encampment. If a horde is destroyed in battle, all its infrastructure is lost along with the army.However, only Nakai’s personal horde can unlock units for recruitment. Other hordes in his faction may then recruit unit types Nakai has unlocked using the Global Recruitment option. These ‘minor’ hordes still have their own infrastructure and building trees, though some of these are focused on reducing Global Recruitment times rather than unlocking units.Defence of the Great PlanThe Great Plan of the Old Ones lies in a delicate balance. Many look to disrupt it, but none defend it as devoutly as Nakai the Wanderer. Nakai begins play with a vassal faction called the Defenders of the Great Plan – the caretakers of the great Temple Cities. When one of Nakai’s armies captures a region, it may be gifted to the Defenders. When a region is gifted thus, Nakai must choose which Old One that region’s temple should be dedicated to.As more temples are dedicated to a specific Old One, the more powerful the rewards bestowed upon Nakai and his faction.These temples generate a unique resource called Old Ones' Favour. Nakai may expend this Favour to access Blessed Spawnings units, or to recruit Lords at much higher ranks.Warmblood InvadersThe avaricious warmbloods look to pillage the temple cities of Lustria for profit. These invaders lurk throughout the jungles; they must be tracked and confronted with cold-blooded ferocity for the Great Plan to remain intact and unimpaired!In the Eye of the Vortex campaign, Nakai must fight to keep Lustria in the rightful hands of the Lizardmen. Several Empire colonies have been established, and each is encroaching on the jungle. They must be dealt with!Four extremely dangerous Hunters co-ordinate the efforts of the warmbloods. Hunt them down to draw out their leader, then defeat them all in a final, epic confrontation!Unique RitesNakai has a selection of new Rites focused around his units, faction mechanics and campaign focus.Rite of Alleigance: Performing this Rite brings Nakai to the attention of the Old Ones, increasing his vassal income and all his Hordes' replenishment rates.Rite of Rebirth: this Rite increases the growth rate for Hordes in Nakai’s faction, reduces construction costs, and reduces unit recruitment and upkeep costs factionwide.Rite of Mastery: This Rite increases the recruitment rank of Kroxigors, Kroxigor Ancients and Sacred Kroxigors, while improving their weapon strength and armour.New units and characters:Nakai the WandererWith high armour, health, melee attack and weapon strength, Nakai is a powerful brawler, well-suited to extended melee. He also grants bonus melee defence to, and reduces the recruitment and upkeep costs, of Kroxigors and Sacred Kroxigors in his army. Nakai also has a number of new support abilities in battle, further cementing his role as the centrepiece of battle: Miasma of Despair: speed, vigour and leadership area-effect debuffPrimal Roar: Increases Nakai’s physical resistance and melee attack, and grants Rampage to alliesGolden Tributes: Perfect Vigour for allies in rangeAncient KroxigorsThese well-armoured, hard hitting, anti-infantry specialists are cast in the mould of Nakai himself, and well-suited to extended melee engagements.  Feral Dread SaurianIf you thought Carnosaurs the apex-predators of Lustria, think again. With breathtaking weapon-damage and high armour, these towering walls of teeth and fury are versatile, elite-killing, melee behemoths, and are subject to Rampage. Dread Saurian (Howdah)Somewhat tamer than their feral cousins, though no less capable, these titanic beasts are ridden into battle by Skink skirmishers, and do not rampage. Combining their terrifying melee power with four giant blowpipes and eight skinks hurling poisoned javelins, it is the ultimate multirole unit.  Shredder of Lustria (Dread Saurian Howdah – Regiment of Renown)With rank nine stats, Encourage, and a passive hex aura reducing nearby enemy leadership, The Shredder of Lustria is truly a one-unit army – and comes with a pricetag to match. Sacred KroxigorsThese versatile and hard-hitting monstrous infantry are great all-rounders. With high weapon-strength and magical attacks, they can plough through against a greater variety of foes than standard Kroxigors. Cohort of Huatl (Sacred Kroxigors – Regiment of Renown)The Cohort of Huatl is a top-tier monstrous infantry unit. Building on the Sacred Kroxigors’ capabilities with additional armour-sundering attacks and bonus physical resistance, they synergise well in the field with Skinks and Saurus Warriors. Razordon Hunting PackFilling the air with deadly grapeshot-style volleys of armour-piercing fire, Razordon Hunting Packs are potent – and mobile – armoured infantry hunters.  Amaxon Barbs (Razordons – Regiment of Renown)Dealing poison damage, and heavily scaled for enhanced missile resistance, these Razordons are pinpoint shooters and make top-notch skirmishers.For more information on FREELC and other frequently asked questions, please click the link Here\",\n",

Purchasing the Darkness Among Us DLC will unlock its new Killer, new Survivor, and an exclusive item for the new survivor.The everyday contains many hazards. But the comforts of routine shroud the unfathomable risks of a threat so intimate, so familiar, that it can only be seen in hindsight. A disturbing, violent force could be raging within the people closest to you. Darkness is among us, every day.The raw cravings and impulses of adolescence are powerful. The desire to belong can be just as unbelievably strong. When three teens get involved with an impulsive mastermind, they discover an addictive kind of freedom. Together, they spiral out of control and become the wrong kind of crowd, The Legion, leaving no rule unbroken. The Darkness Among Us chapter includes Frank and Julie as playable killers.  Jeff Johansen was invited to take a trip down memory lane when his past caught up with him. He returned to his hometown, ready to face everything he had been forced to leave behind. But the familiar isn’t always safe, and it’s never too late to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The LegionFrank’s future was as bleak as his childhood was miserable. To break free from his boring, aimless life in Ormond, Frank manipulated a group of friends and led them to break every rule. The Legion is a group of agile Killers able to catch Survivors off-guard with their power, Feral Frenzy. The Darkness Among Us chapter includes Frank and Julie as playable killers. The Legion’s Power: Feral FrenzyViolent impulses are within us and building incrementally, for some, to a tipping point. They were a plain group of friends until they met Frank, who turned them into a Legion. Now they draw power from the thrilling insane freedom of not abiding by any rule but their own. The Legion use their power, Feral Frenzy, to hunt down their victim. When activating Feral Frenzy, The Legion enter a deadly rage allowing them to sprint and vault over pallets at the cost of lowered senses.- In Feral Frenzy, hitting a Survivor afflicts them with the Deep Wound status effect which slowly but surely bleeds them dry if they don’t mend.- Hitting a Survivor while in Feral Frenzy replenishes The Legion’s entire power gauge, and triggers Killer Instinct, an ability that helps locate other Survivors nearby. The Legion comes with 3 new perks.DiscordanceAny time 2 Survivors or more are working on the same Generator, the Generator's aura is highlighted in white for a limited time.Mad GritWhile carrying a Survivor, you suffer no cooldown for missed attacks and hitting another Survivor pauses the carried Survivor’s wiggle timer.Iron MaidenYou open lockers faster. When a Survivor exits a locker, they emit a loud noise and suffer from the Exposed status effect for a limited time. The Artist with a Heart of GoldBorn and raised in Ormond, Alberta, Jeff Johansen grew up as a quiet, only child with an aversion for large crowds. During high school, his anxious temper was mislabelled as shyness, which he covered up with a tough, stoic persona that intimidated bullies and teachers alike. At home, he collected heavy metal vinyl albums. The evocative symbolism on the covers inspired him to make art of his own, which helped him cope with his parents’ constant fighting. After his parents’ divorce, he was forced to move with his mother to Winkler, Manitoba, miles away from his hometown—and his dad. In Winkler, Jeff was more isolated than ever, except for art and music. His solace came shortly after graduating high school when he started working at a local bar with live music. He found a roadie gig shortly after and left Winkler for good. After an incident at a concert, he reoriented himself and started designing labels for microbreweries. He led a quiet, simple life brewing beer, designing tattoos, and making art for bands he liked. All until one morning, when he got a phone call from Ormond saying that his father had passed, leaving a few things to sort out. Jeff returned to the home he left behind, but he should have never looked back.  Jeff’s personal perks, Breakdown, Aftercare, and Distortion, allow him to break hooks, cooperate with other Survivors, and conceal his aura from The Killer.Jeff Johansen comes with 3 new perks.BreakdownAny time you are removed from a hook (escaped or saved), the hook breaks and the Killer's aura is shown to you for a limited time.AftercareA 2-way link is created between you and the other survivors whether you interact with them while unhooking or after successfully healing each other.You can create a limited amount of links with other Survivors. Existing links will not be replaced until they are removed. If you are hooked by The Killer, all your existing links with other Survivors are removed.DistortionYou start the Trial with 3 tokens. When your aura would be shown to the killer, the perk activates and a token is consumed. For a limited time, while the perk is activated, your aura will not be shown to the Killer.Exclusive Item for JeffThe Darkness Among Us Chapter includes an exclusive item: Jeff’s In the Shadow of Death shirt, only available as part of the DLC. Please note that this item cannot be purchased separately. New Map: Mount Ormond ResortWelcome to Ormond, Alberta. Population: six thousand ninety-three. Surrounded by an impressive mountain range, Ormond’s ski slopes showed promise for a lucrative coal mining venture. The environmentally controversial nature of the project, however, brought the enterprise to an abrupt stop, which left deep scars on Ormond’s landscape and population. The hollowed summit of Mount Ormond now looms over desolate patches of dead trees, a soulful, deforested graveyard where gangs and teenagers go looking for trouble. Some people say that the mountain hides a darkness, a bottomless hole from where no one can return. The abandoned ski facilities still remind the inhabitants of a past that never was. It is a place of broken promises and devastated nature. The stale air worsens during winter, when the rough winds drape a heavy blanket of isolation over the bleak landscape. “The town will leave you with a deep sense of peace. Yet, few ever return.” \",\n",

       "  'full_bio': 'Songs of Syx is in Early Access. We recommend reading the EA clause carefully and playing the demo before purchasing.Songs of Syx is a fantasy city-builder where you start off as an insignificant colony and build, scheme, and fight your way towards a metropolis and empire. The mechanics are complex and true to life, where small events can spiral into the collapse of kingdoms. Easy to learn, but impossible to master. It\\'s set in a low-fantasy world with graphics aimed at stimulating your imagination.Living WorldFull of different races, cultures, old and new gods and strange creatures. Night turns to day, climate and weather change, and migrations of animals and people flow. Droughts and pestilence, pirates and bandits, and new discoveries will ensure kingdoms and empires come and go with or without your intervention. No game will ever be the same, as all content, background stories, and easter-eggs are generated uniquely each iteration, while still sticking to a rich background story that you will unfold piece by piece.Base Building on a Huge ScaleTake your settlement further that you ever have by winning the hearts of your subjects or by whipping them into submission. Have their number swell your insignificant colony into a metropolis of tens of thousands. Be careful not to overreach, as everything you build requires upkeep and a slight disruption of your production, or a dip in your standing, could quickly spiral out of control and your people will not hesitate to depose a thoughtless king.Grand StrategyAs your capital grows, it must be sustained by the villages, towns, lumber camps, castles and ports that constitute your kingdom. But you\\'re not alone in. Other kingdoms and despots are eager to forge an alliance or expand their borders, so tend to your relations and try not to stand out culturally. To grow your might, you must engage in global trade, where there are no fixed prices, no currency to mint, but based on supply and demand, turning you rich one day, and your goods worthless on the next, if you\\'re not paying attention.Massive Tactical BattlesGather forces from allies and vassals and conscript traveling mercenaries and heroes to bolster your ranks with up to 20k individual units. Use tactics and skill to encircle your enemy, or let your reputation demoralize them before clashes of up to 40k units, which outcomes dictate the rise and fall of empires.Nobility & SlavesBreak the backs of slaves as they make your beds and swab your floors. Just throw them a bone from time to time to keep them from rising up in revolt. Appoint nobles, or import them from other kingdoms and have them manage different aspects of your kingdom to boosts your production and standing, but be careful with whom to trust, and reward them accordingly as some might get the idea to usurp you or join your enemies.Matching SoundtrackThanks to the fulfilment of our first Kickstarter stretchgoal the game will have a fully fledged soundtrack made by @jasinkamusic. We already have some tracks done which neatly fit into the playable prototype.Explore the lives and personalities of your subjects as you build the basic necessities to survive your first winter. Hunt and forage and farm to keep them fed and weave clothes to keep them warm.The people that makes up your settlement come in many different races, with their own skills and flaws. Each one is an individual, with its own personality, agenda, preferences, friends and traits.You don\\'t control them directly, you rather make the plans and they execute intelligently. If you take good care of them, more will immigrate to your settlement. If you wrong them, they might serve you inefficiently, or openly rebel against you.Take your settlement further that you ever have before by winning the hearts of your subjects or by whipping them into submission. Build cities with up to 30k individuals.As your numbers swell, you will stop focusing on the individuals and turn your attention towards groups. A group can be described as a combination of race, social standing, religion and trade.And in Songs of Syx, subjects don\\'t like those who are different from them. It is up to you if you want to encourage such behavior by discriminating some groups and imposing privileges on another, or if you want to create a diverse and tolerant society, utilizing the different traits of races.Call your banners and swell your ranks with mercenaries and boost the morale of your soldiers with a hero or two. Enjoy massive battles, that aim to be realistic with low kill rate and fragile morale, as you fend off an invader, or reclaim a kingdom that is rightfully yours.Your city might get raided by bandits. Raiders wants your goods, and if you don\\'t surrender them they will attack. As you grow, battles will mostly take place outside of cities and out on the field.And the battle matters. It will take years to build up a force and if you\\'re defeated, the enemy will hunt down those fleeing and annihilate your army, while suffering minor casualties themselves. You will then have to sue for a costly peace, unless you have enough manpower and funds to quickly raise another.Syx is a living world, full of different races, cultures, old and new gods and strange creatures. Night turns to day, climate and weather change, and migrations of animals and people are on the move.Droughts and pestilence, pirates and bandits, and new discoveries will ensure kingdoms and empires come and go with or without your intervention. No game will ever be the same, as all content, background stories, and easter-eggs are generated uniquely each iteration, while still sticking to a rich background story that you will unfold piece by piece.The story goes that Syx and its races were once united under a mighty empire, overseen by the Gods of Order themselves. Harmony and peace ensued for many a centuries, as vast road networks and outposts connected the thriving cities. But one unfortunate day, a faction of greedy Men stumbled upon the prison of the God of Chaos and freed him on the promise of immortality. As the gods fought, the cities were erased and priceless artifacts and tomes of knowledge were lost. Outnumbered and desperate, the chaos lord unleashed a plague on the world, turning the dead into soldiers to refill his ranks, and used magical weapons of fire that layed waste to the remaining kingdoms and fortresses. Finally, all the avatars of the gods of order had been slain and thus banished from the physical realm. Failing to deliver his promise of immortality the god of chaos was assassinated by his fickle followers, and as he fell came with him ice and snow that covered the whole of Syx for an age.But, good news! The ice has now receded and the world is in dire need of your leadership.Play as the Dondorians, masterful miners with a will cut in stone. They spend their lives digging for Dyhrlium, fighting their arch enemies - the Amevias - and dreaming of rebuilding their legendary capital at Mt. Cerebus. They are mysteriously born fully grown, capable miners, and live long lives, preferably deep inside the mountains.Or play as Men, fragile and mortal, but equipped with free will and an ingenuity that has the potential to far surpass their Dondorian cousins. Unite their shattered and warring kingdoms under one banner, but beware of temptation that may lead you astray. And do hurry up, as there are whispers of the dark lord of chaos\\' return!After the war of the gods, the few Kantors that remained withdrew from the world to spend their remaining millennia in the frozen north. They are filled with wrath and disgust for men and their treasonous nature and generally stay clear of civilization, but if you\\'re lucky you might be able to attract a few to your city, where they will be of tremendous worth.Here is some feedback from our prototype players;\"So I\\'ve been playing it for about 2 hours and holy crap... It\\'s really good... Like... Really good.\"\"I have like 0-2 games every couple of years that check all my marks. Games that I will love and play.\"\"I wasted an inordinate amount of time on your demo due to how good and compelling it already was and I can only wish you the very best.\"\"I was initially put off a bit by the UX/UI but pushed past the first 15 minutes of the tutorial. Once I got the hang of it and restarted I, without realizing it, spent the next 3 hours playing... so good job.\"\"Not too many games can suck me in like that.\"\"This is one of the coolest projects I have seen in a long time... I downloaded it yesterday and already have 4 hours in... its amazing!!!\"All of this will not happen over night. Currently, the base game contains 60-70% of the features, but these haven\\'t been fleshed out and everything is unpolished. The release in September will only contain a good number of the features listed, while some few might be dropped and others added. The game has been a prototype for 6 years and will be in EA for a long, long time, although the aim is that it will still be fun to play during these years. You are more than welcome to tag along for the ride, but only if you like what\\'s already been created, feel enthusiastic about the vision and have money to spare in these difficult times.The game is theoretically ready to launch as EA on steam today, but there are a few things we want to add before that along with some polish.Until now, focus has been on adding and fleshing out the basic ingredients that makes a city builder. Ultimately, This game is a long term thing. In the near future we hope to implement empire management and nobility. EA launch is planned for 21th of September 2020.',\n",

Some examples include popularity ratings, political relations, and economic exchanges between countries. Various organizations, including NATO, use the technologies in the Power & Revolution simulator for education and training.Over one thousand playable actions. At the country’s helm, the player/head of state can act in many areas: budget, taxation (nearly thirty types of taxes), currency, economy (over 130 economic activities), foreign and domestic affairs, defense, society, labor, health, social security, education, environment, transportation, culture, and more.Propose bills to be voted on in Parliament, for example: setting social welfare benefit minimums, changing the retirement age, developing atomic weapons in secret, subsidizing the auto industry, hiring teachers, defining the powers of unions, setting speed limits on roads, regulating prostitution, creating an international film festival, etc.The player can also construct elements on the world map, which will change accordingly: nuclear plants, wind farms, military bases, pipelines, high-speed train lines, airports, and many more.SIMULATIONS OF MAJOR GLOBAL THREATSThe Geopolitical Simulator 2020 Edition simulates all the major perils that threaten the planet and produces a comprehensive assessment for each one from the results along with specific graphics. The list of threats is substantial and many of them are interconnected: global warming, the widening of social inequality, the risk of global atomic war, overpopulation, unemployment, atmospheric pollution, terrorism, cybercrime, regional conflicts, food insecurity, world hunger, deforestation, natural disasters (storms, floods, drought, extreme heat...), rising sea levels, ocean acidity, disappearance of animal species, climate refugees, epidemics, endocrine-disrupting chemicals…PLAY AS THE OPPOSITIONAt the head of a legal or illegal organization, the player can take power by force, revolution, diplomacy, or democratic election. To that end, players have many actions at their disposal: manage the budget of the party or illegal organization, intervention in the media, give voting advice to Parliament, launch protest movements, lobbying, manipulation of influential persons, funding or recruitment campaigns, creation of violent cells, purchase military equipment, raise an army, seek allies, engage in armed conflict... During elections, players must manage their campaign budget, establish their political agenda, complete their meeting itinerary, confront their adversary in televised debates…AI CONTROLLED LOBBYISTS AND CHARACTERSAll actions of the player as head of state or opposition have repercussions and lobbies, social groups, and important national and international figures will intervene if their artificial intelligence deems necessary (press interviews, resignations, protests, strikes, unrest, blocked roads, wars...).To prevent tensions or forge alliances, the player can meet any figure during the meeting or intervene in the media (more than 10 hours of dialogue in the game).REALISTIC WARGAMES AND CITY BATTLE PHASESThe world map incorporates all places of conflict down to the smallest detail: occupied territories, besieged cities, locations of military units, international military bases, personnel and equipment of terrorist groups... As a warlord, players can direct all of their units from real bases during military conflicts. City battles are shown on precise maps with all the major buildings and intersections. The players, according to the side they represent, can direct police, hooligans, military personnel or armed extremists to these locations and construct barricades, send in snipers, loot the banks, or have armoured vehicles move in.SECRET SERVICESSecret services play an important role. They have an arsenal of espionage and \\\\\"special\\\\\"\" operations: reveal scandals about an opposing political party, dismantle terrorist networks, sabotage foreign infrastructure, assassinate an opponent, send reconnaissance drones or position satellites to locate enemy units, etc.INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONSInternational organizations (over 50 organizations included) play an important role. At the UN, for example, the player can denounce a nation in order to obtain the Security Council’s authorization for a military intervention. The player can also create his or her own organization.INCLUDES MULTIPLE OPTIONS    • Game operating as single-player with a multi-country mode allowing play with several countries simultaneously    • Game settings: terrorist activities, probabilities of natural disasters, reactivity of the populations, outbreak of war    • Player ranking online and in real time    • Incorporation of your own photos, logos, names to make the game even more realistic    • Interactive tutorial and game help available at all times during the game (in beginner mode)    • Learn about geopolitics by playing the QUIZZ mode, including more than 3000 questions    • Enjoy different configurations with double screen or 4K screen offering a customized interface    • Avec l\\'extension Modding Tool, (add-on prochainement en vente sur ce site), vous aurez la possibilité de créer et de partager vos propres scénarios et contextes géopolitiques ou bien de télécharger ceux des autres utilisateurs    • With the Modding Tool extension (add-on soon available for purchase on this site), you\\'ll be able to create and share your own geopolitical scenarios and contexts or even download those of other users    • Text and dialog 100% in EnglishNEW CONTENT FOR 2020Simulation of the Covid-19 Pandemic...Based on actual data, the pandemic is recreated and the player can follow its progress with various graphs, stats and maps and is kept up to date directly by their Health Director. Numerous tools and legislation are at your disposal to try and slow the spread of the virus: managing inventory and distribution policies (masks for professionals and the general public, screening tests, treatments, ICU beds), construction of temporary hospitals, an arsenal of lockdown measures (for the population, for schools, businesses, bars and restaurants), limiting gatherings and travel, regulating transportation, closing the borders, use of tracking software, transfer of patients and vaccine research.All of these measures can be customized by region and their level of contamination, the objective being to stem the pandemic as quickly as possible and to slow its progress to limit the impact on the economy....and the Economic CrisisDepending on the situation, the player can impose, or lift, restrictions on businesses. In response to the decline in business, various measures can be put into place: partial unemployment, aid for the poor or support for struggling economic sectors to minimize unemployment and the decline in growth.The debt and deficit of a country can be strongly affected by this crisis and if, in the short term, the State can rely on international lenders, especially when a member of the European Union, then the player will have to return to more acceptable levels in the long term so as not to alarm financial markets.Other ScenariosIn \"The World Without Covid\", the player can lead their country in a \"normal\" context, without the pandemic.In the \"SARS-CoV-3 Mutation\" scenario, set in 2022, when, after a widespread vaccination of the world population for Covid-19, researchers discover a new patient carrying a virus that seems to resistant to the vaccine.

       "  'full_bio': \"MechWarrior Online™ Solaris 7MechWarrior Online™ Solaris 7 is a tactical, 'Mech-based online shooter set in the vast BattleTech Universe. In the 31st century the battlefields are dominated by immense and powerful mechanized units called BattleMechs. Join the ranks of elite operators tasked with piloting these war machines. Choose your path to becoming the most feared MechWarrior in the Inner Sphere, fighting for battlefield supremacy against other players.Enter the Solaris Arena.The newest addition to MechWarrior online™, Solaris 7, features 1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2 Mech Combat across 7 Divisions. Choose your BattleMech wisely, each of the 7 Divisions has a limited roster of BattleMechs available based on the Mech’s performance capabilities on the battlefield. Take a Patron Contract, pick up sponsors, and earn accolades as you climb to the top of the Divisions Leaderboards. Solaris 7 features 5 maps tailored for intense Mech Combat.Quick Play is where you'll find fast action, fielding a single 'Mech in team-based game modes and maps. Unlike Faction Play, Quick Play matches do not influence the layout of Inner Sphere territories; these battles are fought purely for rewards and glory.In Faction Play you will field 4 ‘Mechs per match, lending your skills and allegiance to the Faction of your choosing in prolonged team-based engagements, conquering and defending planets in their name to earn rewards and expand your Faction's territory across the Inner Sphere.Gameplay Piloting a 'Mech to victory requires a mastery of tactical positioning, teamwork, and firing discipline. Strike out as a Lone Wolf or seek out one of the many player-controlled Units and fight under the banners of powerful galactic empires for prestige, wealth, or nothing more than the sheer thrill of battle. Next Gen Mobility  - By the 31st century, tanks have evolved to take on humanoid shape, their treads replaced with nimble legs. Like modern tanks, 'Mechs move their upper torso and weapons independently of their legs offering unparalleled mobility while exchanging fire. Depending on their size, BattleMechs travel at vastly different speeds and offer different systems like jump jets to aid in their locomotion.Make Every Shot Count  - Pilots must balance mobility and damage output against the amount of heat generated from their weapons fire and 'Mech operation, lest they risk the temporary loss of power that comes when a 'Mech overheats. Firing all weapons simultaneously (known as an Alpha Strike) can be the quickest way to devastate an opponent, but may leave a 'Mech helpless against its enemies if the heat sinks can't handle the stress.Fight Smart  - 'Mechs possess both external armor and strong internal structural elements to help minimize the chance of a 'quick kill'. As a result, pilots must treat each encounter with the utmost attention and awareness, prioritizing weaker or more critical components before delivering the killing blow. Communication among teammates and the effective use of targeting systems can help to identify vulnerable 'Mechs and components.Teamwork is the Difference  - Targeting a 'Mech will automatically allow your teammates to achieve their own lock, allowing them to ascertain vital location data, armor status, and loadout details for the targeted enemy. Information Warfare can be a vital component for victory, providing attack-focused allies with the necessary information to tear their opponents to pieces.Information Warfare - While fast-moving scouts feed target and tactical information back to the main battle group and the team commander, long-range Support and heavy-hitting Brawler and Assault ‘Mechs will use this information to position themselves for the perfect strike. Pilots can also shield themselves and allies from enemy sensors and weapons fire using various counter measures. It is up to each pilot to customize their BattleMech loadout to fulfill their desired role. Find the perfect 'Mech - Hundreds of unique 'Mechs are available, offering a wide range of strengths and weaknesses. Smaller 'Mechs should never stop moving, and can rely on their sheer speed to overwhelm heavier opponents. Larger 'Mechs move slow and deliberate but can stand toe-to-toe with other large opponents. Acquire and test different 'Mechs to find those that best suit your play style.Choose Your Allegiance  - Work for the powerful empires of the galaxy to earn their loyalty and spread their influence across the stars. Band together with other pilots using the Looking For Group feature, or use the Faction Chat feature to coordinate offensive and defensive strategies to capture or defend worlds and shift the balance of power.Get Rewarded  - Pilots earn ComStar Bills (C-Bills) from playing matches and completing faction contracts, which can be used to purchase new 'Mechs and equipment.Certain items can only be purchased using premium 'Mech Credits (MC). MC can either be purchased directly via real world money or acquired in smaller increments in-game by earning reputation with a Faction in Faction Play, or as rewards from participating in special Events.'Mech Experience (XP) gained during combat is applied to the 'Mech used during that match, and can be used to unlock improvements to various BattleMech systems.MechWarrior Online™ also includes a host of achievements to unlock that will challenge even the most skilled players.\",\n",

Those who rebel against the coalition take on a purely militant view, coming to the opinion that the only way to bring peace is by ultimately crushing all who oppose them - especially xenos.For the first time in their history, the war creates a schism in the Advent Unity. The loyalists seek to continue their policy of revenge against the Traders, and to assimilate all others to the Unity’s influence. However, others amongst the Advent suspect that a corrupting influence from within has diverted the Unity from its proper destiny.The divide created in the Vasari Empire is less pronounced, but just as severe to their people. With the Vasari now practically frantic to move on to new space, the loyalist faction abandons cooperation and decides to take the resources they need by any means necessary. Having accepted the need to work together, the rebel faction feels that their best chance for survival is to work with the other races and bring them along to flee the approaching enemy.Take the battle for galactic supremacy to its ultimate level in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion – a standalone RT4X game that combines the tactics of real-time strategy with the depth of the 4X genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate).Key features:New Factions:  Decide whether to play as a Loyalist or Rebel – each unlocks new technologies, ships and play styles for each race.New Titan Class Warships:  Mighty titans enter the fray of the war to tip the scales of power.

Featuring an all new environment and SFX, these missions teach AA defense skills, rush building and structural durability. In addition to this, players can create their own training missions and upload them via the Steam Workshop._______________________________Tons of GunsThis major free update adds two tech buildings which allow commanders access to six formidable new weapons. The Armoury unlocks Flak guns to clear the skies of enemy projectiles, and EMP rockets to power down enemy tech, both of which can be upgraded to the Shotgun and twin Rocket launcher, respectively. The classic Cannon is now found in the new Munitions Plant, where it is joined by it's little brother, the burst-firing 20mm Cannon. The Factory now produces two beam weapons, the classic Plasma Laser and the new Firebeam, great for penetrating fortifications to ignite them from within._______________________________Repair StationIn an effort to reduce APM and to add another element of strategy, we have created the Repair Station. Available as a device built directly from the Reactor, the Repair Station repairs damage to surrounding building materials and devices as and when they are damaged in exchange for an ongoing resource cost. Multiple Repair Stations can be built at a time, but should be placed with care to maximise their coverage, while also ensuring they don’t put too much of a strain on your economy.Ranked MultiplayerPlayers who opt to play ranked matches will have the result of their battles figure into their score, and their rank will be adjusted accordingly on the public Leaderboard.

Composed of fast-paced 3D fighting games that began with the original DEAD OR ALIVE arcade game in 1996, and have since appeared on a multitude of consoles and arcade machines around the world. In DEAD OR ALIVE 6, the world of DOA is brought back more vibrant than ever, featuring both enhanced visuals and an updated combat systems, aimed to provide the highest possible level of new fighting entertainment. [Story]The story will follow the events of DEAD OR ALIVE 5, focusing on 2 separate main narratives; namely, the battle between “Ninja and DOATEC” versus “M.I.S.T. lead by Donovan”, and the events that occur during the 6th DEAD OR ALIVE Tournament. New side story episodes will also be added for returning characters.[The New Visuals]With the help of a new graphics engine, DOA6 aims to bring visual entertainment of fighting games to an entirely new level. The graphics are made to be both enticingly beautiful and realistic, bringing out enhanced facial expressions, such special effects as depiction of sweat and dirt on character models, and realistic hit effects.[The Triangle System]Following the tradition, fights in DEAD OR ALIVE 6 are based on a triangle system: strikes beat throws, throws beat holds, and holds beat strikes. Landing a well-timed attack of the type that beats your opponent’s attack, like landing a strike when an opponent tries to throw, will result in a Hi Counter attack and do more damage.[New Combat Mechanics - Break System]In this new title, we are introducing a new Special Move Gauge (Break Gauge) to the DEAD OR ALIVE series, adding a new dramatic strategic element to the fights. This element is made to be accessible and easy to use even for people who are new to the world of fighting games, and is activated by simply pressing the [RB] button.[Break Blow] A strong, high-damage special move that knocks your opponents down. The first part of the move also parries incoming attacks, working as both an offensive and defensive move![Break Hold] A convenient counter technique that can also be used while the player is heavily stunned. It should only be used in tight situations due to its light-damage output.[Fatal Rush]A powerful combo with a dramatic finishing move, activated by consecutively pressing the [RB] button. While it is made to be easy to use for beginner players, it can also be employed in more than one creative way by the experienced competitors.[New Danger Zones][Rumble Danger]If knocked into onlookers, they will push the player back into the center of the stage. It is a trap that combines the atmosphere of a real street fight with strategy.[Mass-Destruction]If the opponent is knocked back into a large stack of boxes or barrels with a “Break Blow” or ”Fatal Rush” it will cause a large chain-explosion. This will lead to a huge burst of damage and produces an exhilarating rush.\",\n",

Do the viking raiders make off with your villagers? Or are they stopped, full of arrows, at the castle gates? Does a dragon torch your granary, your people dying of starvation in the winter, or are you able to turn the beast back? The success of your kingdom depends solely on your skill as a city and castle planner.Strategically layout your town to improve your peasants' happiness and to attract new residents. Tax them just enough to fund your castle. Make sure your peasants are fed in the winter and healed of plagues. Build churches to keep them from despair and taverns to keep them happy. You can even throw festivals if you've built a town square! Send out wood cutters to collect wood, set up stone quarries to build your castles, and farm the land efficiently so your town can grow and thrive.The new land you're settling is at risk of viking invasion. These raiders seek to kidnap and kill your peasants, steal your resources, and burn your town to the ground. Use a powerful castle building system where castles are constructed using blocks which can be placed anywhere. Towers and walls are dynamically created based on how you stack and arrange them. Archer towers and other weapon emplacements have longer range the higher their tower. Try different layouts to best protect your kingdom and express your glory as a king or queen.And it all takes place in a beautiful dynamic world with a stylized procedural cloud system and season cycle from summer to winter.  A realistic tree growth algorithm simulates the forests. Depending on your needs, wood cutters can clear cut or responsibly manage your forests.Kingdoms and Castles is the first Fig funded game to be released. Its crowd funding campaign succeeded with 725% of its goal and was supported by 1,400 backers. Supporters of the game could both pledge and invest during the Fig campaign.\",\n",

This has resulted in a spectacular game born from the game production skills cultivated by Team Ladybug.And I personally want to highlight the beauty of the anime sprite. You can see the attention to detail the creator put into not only the leading character\\'s movements, but the effects and enemy characters. Touhou Luna Nights is not only for Touhou fans but one that can be enjoyed by anyone who loves 2D action games.',\n",

Initially, you are in disguise, and it\\'s up to you to gain trust of other players to lure them away form the group and have them go missing. Your arsenal consists of useful gadgets such as bear traps, a secret control room, smoke bombs, and more. The best players in the game are the ones who convince groups of people that someone else is the Neighbor. It feels like that scene from \"The Thing\" where characters test each other for who\\'s the traitor. Practice your roleplay skills.Playing as the intrudersA group of friends are searching for their missing friend. Everyone thinks he\\'s locked in the creepy Neighbor\\'s basement. The only logical thing to do is to break into the neighbor\\'s house and into his basement. Intruders come equipped with classes and different abilities. Bagger will have extra storage space, Brave will be able to give everyone a speed boost, the Detective knows where the keys are, and more. Using these abilities, players need to scavenge the house for basement keys, and valuable loot they can use to upgrade their skills and equipment.For a full guide of How To Play the game, please check this video',\n",

       "  'full_bio': 'Ultimate General: Civil War is a tactical war-game. Experience the bloodiest period of U.S. history - the American Civil War of 1861-1865. MAIN FEATURESFull campaign: Fight in the American Civil War campaign and participate in 50+ battles from small engagements to massive battles that can last several days over hundreds of square miles of terrain. Campaign fully depends on player actions and battle results. Historical battles can also be played separately.The game includes the following battles in the campaign:Battle of Aquia CreekBattle of Philippi1st Battle of Bull RunBattle of ShilohBattle of Gaines\\' MillBattle of Malvern Hill2nd Battle of Bull RunBattle of AntietamBattle of FredericksburgBattle of Stones RiverBattle of ChancellorsvilleBattle of GettysburgBattle of ChickamaugaBattle of Cold HarborBattle of RichmondBattle of Washington+ 48 smaller scale battlesArmy management: You are the general. You have full control over the army composition. Based on your successes and reputation you might get access to more corps, divisions and brigades. Keep your soldiers alive and they will learn to fight better, turning from green rookies to crack veterans. Lose a lot of your soldiers and you might not have enough reinforcements to deliver victories. Your reputation will suffer, army morale will drop and you will be forced to resign.Innovative command system: You decide which level of control you want. Command every unit individually or just give them a main goal with one button click and watch if they can take that hill. Army divisions commanders can make decisions on their own and help you control the largest army. Draw a defensive line and allocated brigades will defend it like lions. Or design a deep flanking maneuver by just drawing an arrow and send the whole army to the enemy flank or the rear. Your generals will try to fulfill your orders, although \"no plan survives contact with the enemy\".Officer progression: Historical unit commanders progress and become better fighters together with the player. The Officers rank up based on their units’ performance, but it\\'s war and they can be wounded or even get killed in action. New ranks open new possibilities and allow officers to lead bigger units without efficiency loss. Winning battles also opens new possibilities for you as a general, increasing skills such as reconnaissance or political influence.Historical weapons: There is huge variety of Civil War weaponry from mass produced Enfield pattern rifles to rare Whitworths. Historical availability has also been implemented. Certain weapons can only be captured by raiding supplies or taken from the enemy on the battlefield. Enhanced unit control: Detach skirmishers to send them to scout those hills ahead. Or merge several brigades into one bigger division if it’s needed. Dismount the cavalry to become less visible to the enemy or mount for fast flanking charges and supply raids. Supplies are extremely important and you have to plan and defend the provisions otherwise the battle might end for you early.Advanced Artificial Intelligence: You will face a strong enemy. AI will flank you, will hit your weak spots and undefended high ground, will chase and cut your supplies and will try to destroy unguarded artillery batteries. AI will use terrain and will take cover and retreat if overwhelmed. Terrain matters: Trenches, lines, fences, houses, fields – everything can help to achieve victory, if you know how to use it. Hills will allow you to see enemy units earlier. Rivers and bridges can become natural obstacles that will help you to defend. Forests can help you hide your movements and flank the enemy. Beautiful maps: We believe that modern technology allows hardcore war-games to finally stop being brown on green hexes. Hardcore, deep war games can be beautiful. In our game, every historical battle landscape is accurately hand-drawn, utilizing data from satellite and historical maps. The topography plays immense strategic role and helps to understand how battles were fought and to learn history.',\n",

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, et cetera. The player can then decide to place one of his followers, so called Meeples, on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner. Each new game is a new experience thanks to the ever-changing landscape.ENJOY FUN AND TACTICAL GAMEPLAYDuring a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: \"Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?\" or \"Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, making it harder for him to complete his goal and score points?\" Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.2 EXPANSIONS : ENLARGE YOUR LANDSCAPE AND OPTIMIZE YOUR POINTSThanks to the mini expansions \"The River\" and \"The Abbot\", you can embellish your landscape and vary your game to enjoy new ways to play!FEATURES• Fun and tactical gameplay adapted from the award-winning Carcassonne board game• 2 expansions: The River and The Abbot• Solo mode• Pass & Play on the same device with your friends and family \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 • Detection of blocked locations once the tile is placed.• Online multiplayer mode includes:- Public games to play with players all around the world - Private games to invite your friends - Ranked games and leaderboards- Chat & Lobby• 3D modelisation (vs 2D for the previous versions and the physical game)• Additional strategic layers compared to the physical version:- field view which allows you to see the field possession of each player- remaining tile list: allows you to see the tiles which are remaining in the draw pile• 2D/3D view swapLanguages available: English, French, German Italian, Spanish',\n",

       "  'full_bio': ' Administrator and monsters, you cannot possibly imagine.  Lobotomy Corp is a Monster Management Rogue-Lite Simulation game.Our game was inspired by the monsters from game and movies such as SCP series, Cabin in the woods and Warehouse 13. Furthermore, it was developed from the thought of “What if those monsters were real and your job is to manage them”. You will be playing as an administrator of the company which is in the management of such creatures. These monsters generate a new energy source, and your job is to collect them through giving out to your subordinates. Through this process, you can open new departments that facility allows and encounter various monsters. In the game, the player will have to go through the company’s fear and tension filled the atmosphere. “Our new technology will bring salvation to the human race.” Lobotomy corporation is a newly established energy company that extracts an infinite amount of entropy through the isolation of abnormality with our self-developed technology. This is only an impression that the public has regarding our company. You will see its reality after you have joined us.Our facility is formed of many departments just like any other companies. You will have access to various departments as you gather more energy. The more you have access to various departments, the much easier the management of abnormality will become.Furthermore, an AI ‘Angela’ and ‘Sephira’ will be by your side to support your needs for the smooth process of work. An existence you constantly have to examine and observe. We have decided to call the monsters in Lobotomy as ‘Abnormality’.You will have to try your best to keep your employees out of danger while keeping the energy extraction level at its maximum.At first, you won’t have any information on Abnormality. You will only have your eyes and the manual to guide you. Speculate which process will be most suitable for each Abnormality. After that, just pick and place your employee who is best suited for the job and wait for results. Also, you will have to gather information through giving out orders to your employees to ‘examine’ the creature. You get the power to obtain information in the process of managing Abnormality.Abnormality’s energy generation level depends on their conditions This game is NOT a tycoon.As mentioned before, Abnormality is a creature that should be handled with an extreme alert. Some of them might don’t like the idea of humans keeping them locked up in chambers. They will try to escape when they have a chance and when they do, they will destroy everything. Be it our employees or the facility.Furthermore, certain Abnormality can brainwash and corrupt our employees into their pawn. These ‘pawns’ can have a bad effect on other employees and might randomly attack the people around them. Also, they also bring down the other employees’ mentality level which might result in disobedience. You could get rid them of course, but you should consider the fact that all the information and data regarding that employee will be deleted as well. One disaster will cause another, and it will lead everything into chaos.If you do not stop them instantly, the situation will get out of hand and fall into chaos. When this situation does occur, you will have to decide whether you will gather employees to recapture the Abnormality, or destroy some part of the facility with explosives to secure the company’s safety. “Do you have any wishes, administrator?” Lobotomy corporation is divided into work procedure and the story mode. In work procedure, you will be doing your job as the company’s administrator managing the Abnormality and the energy generation level. A game’s story will follow right afterward. In Story mode, there is a dialogue with Sephira, including AI Angela, which will also appear in the work part. Through the mission they give, you will come closer to the truth hidden in the company. Furthermore, the player will be placed in a situation where they must answer or ask questions. You can also discover secrets surrounding the company and the player.',\n",

Stranded on the world of Auriga, they had to survive the harsh climate and even harsher neighbors. Once more among the stars, following their uncontested leader Ilona Zolya, the people that now call themselves the Aurigans still seek traces of their past as well as a safe place to finally call home.The Best Offense Is A Good Defense The Vaulters are a scientific- and military-oriented faction. They play defensive with strong population traits oriented towards system protection. Their teleport ability can carry fleets across the galaxy from one Vaulters system to another. Strong allies in peaceful times, it would be foolish to provoke the Vaulters into aggression.Strong Civilizations Need Heroes…Befitting a tradition of resilience and unending curiosity, Vaulters Heroes are better governors than admirals. Their skills range from great system defense bonuses to improved scientific output.The Vaulters Expansion also marks the return of Opbot DV8 as an unlockable hero.… Powerful Fleets… Reminiscing of Mezari designs of old on Auriga, the new Vaulters ships are much like their makers: resilient, sturdy, gorgeous to a fault. They are reliant on a high number of defense modules, along with strong support capacities, that make them a tough opponent in battle. One of the new exotic modules will even allow you to board enemy ships and eventually take total control of them.…and Merciless Allies.Once living in Auriga as a group of warrior clerics, the Sisters of Mercy joined the Vaulters in their quest for a new home.

In exchange for payment, you can now get a special treatment by supporting them, and even use them to ruthlessly attack other factions.

       "  'full_bio': \"About This ContentThe largest and most detailed Total War: THREE KINGDOMS DLC to dateBegin a campaign in 182 CE just before the Yellow Turban rebellion……Then play through the conflict and deep into the Three Kingdoms periodNew characters and six new playable warlords including the Zhang brothers and Emperor Ling Unique new campaign mechanics, events and objectives40 new battlefield units and new unit abilities Play the origin stories of legendary characters such as Cao Cao and Liu BeiThe year is 182CE. The Han Empire is in turmoil, and China is slipping towards chaos. The Emperor’s court is paralysed by corruption, and a great famine has ravaged the north. In the eyes of the people, Emperor Ling has lost the Mandate of Heaven – and with it, the right to rule.Across the land, the people band together in opposition. Led by the three Taoist brothers Zhang Jue, Zhang Liang and Zhang Bao, they don yellow turbans and take up arms. Their aim: to tear down the unjust Han and replace it with their own dynasty of harmony and peace. They are thousands strong, with more flocking to their cause by the day.Warlords sworn to the emperor rally to his banner; warriors of great influence and fierce ability. Yet the wiser, more ambitious of them harbour their own desires… if the Han becomes too weak, who then will take the reins of power?The Total War: THREE KINGDOMS – Mandate of Heaven Chapter Pack depicts the events of the Yellow Turban Rebellion, enabling players to engage in the conflict from either rebel or loyalist perspectives. Introducing a number of new characters and playable faction leaders, the campaign begins in 182CE, but players can choose to continue well into the Three Kingdoms period, with familiar characters entering the campaign as the timeline progresses.The Han DynastyAs part of the free Total War: THREE KINGDOMS game update for all players which activates when Mandate of Heaven launches, Han Chinese factions may adopt the new Empire government style (Emperor Ling of course has this from the outset of the campaign).The Emperor and his allies are in an alliance where the Emperor holds total power. The Emperor has mandated powers to prevent his allies from voting on diplomatic deals such as war and peace. However, as this is effectively an abuse of power, such actions may cause schisms in the alliance…In Mandate of Heaven, Liu Hong (Emperor Ling) has a unique form of this Empire government style, in that he must request these mandated powers from his imperial allies in order to battle the Yellow Turban threat. In addition, he may also construct the Imperial Palace, a grand undertaking in both time and resources, which delivers powerful factionwide bonuses to the Emperor, and houses the single most powerful garrison in the game!Victory ConditionsThe victory conditions of all Han factions match those of the 190CE campaign. Timing in this period is crucial however, given the power-blocs in play. It’s very much about picking your moment to start your race for the throne and finding rebel-held commanderies to attack opportunistically. The only exception is Liu Hong (Emperor Ling), whose victory conditions will change depending on how he reforms his government.Han FactionsLiu Hong (Emperor Ling) Liu Hong is Emperor of the Han Empire, and presides over a swiftly deteriorating situation. Rebellions are rising and there is discontent amongst his own vassal warlords. His court is controlled by corrupt and self-serving eunuchs who are quick to silence any who question them. The formidable Empress, his wife, fights tooth-and-nail against the eunuchs’ power-grab, but her efforts are hindered by the Emperor's inaction. The vast Han vassal lands are Liu Hong’s to maintain, but the situation is rapidly falling apart, and controlling all of them may be impossible as discontent and open warfare erupt…Unique Faction Mechanic: The Imperial CourtWithin the Imperial Court, three factions vie for supremacy.  The Bureaucrats: Led by the eunuchs, their supporters seek to centralise power into the hands of the politicians. The Warlords: Supporters of this group seek a decentralised government where each local leader controls their own lands, answering only to the emperor. The Dynasts: This group seeks all power to come from the imperial family itself. The Emperor sits in the middle, trying to balance these power blocks. He can wield his Political Influence to enact changes within a court that has been all but crippled by the eunuchs’ power-grab…Political influence grows over time and is generated by administrative court buildings within the player’s major settlementsPolitical influence can be used to remove corrupt ministers from the courtVery high levels of political influence can be expended to annex entire factions within the Empire.Liu ChongLiu Chong is the Emperor's kin, but not heir to the throne. Unlike his family, he is happy to focus on managing his land. The people he governs love him, due to a combination of his own bold personality and his skill in battle. He is determined to make his holdings a place of peace and prosperity for any and all who wish to seek haven there. He feels confident that his imperial kin will get the situation under control, and whilst he will defend them, he is more concerned with keeping his people and his territory safe. Owners of Mandate of Heaven will also be able to begin a campaign in 190 CE as Liu Chong, and his historical conflict with Yuan Shu.Unique resource: FortitudeLiu Chong has a unique resource called fortitude. This rises as he fights battles, and confers a suite of increasingly powerful military bonuses for his troops.Unique Faction Mechanic: TrophiesBy achieving a proscribed series of feats in battle, Liu Chong can unlock trophies which grant unique bonus effects. Liu Chong can choose a limited set of trophies to display in order to gain these bonuses.Lu ZhiOne of the most preeminent scholars of the Han Dynasty, Lu Zhi made a name for himself as an excellent teacher, with such students as Liu Bei and Gongsun Zan studying under him. He was a pivotal figure during the Yellow Turban rebellion, leading many successful assaults against the rebels. While a master of scholarship and the sword, he was less prepared to compete with the Eunuchs.Unique Faction Mechanic: The Great LibraryBy achieving a prescribed series of civic feats, Lu Zhi can collect a range of unique works to populate the library. Up to five works can be displayed at any one time with each work offering unique bonuses. Some works belong to sets and offer further bonuses if displayed together.Yellow Turban Rebellion Unique MechanicsThe three Zhang brothers, architects of the Yellow Turban Rebellion, each get unique missions to energise the movement. Some of these missions will improve their own factions, whilst others will enhance their allies. A few missions may even bring you into contact with faces old and new...Unique resources and effects: Zeal and FervourZeal represents the flames of rebellion, which must be stoked for the rebellion to succeed.  This resource is shared across all three Zhang brothers’ factions, but depletes over time. As Zeal falls, the rebellion can falter, causing your counties to rise up in favour of the Han cause. Zeal is maintained by capturing counties and fighting battles. Fervour represents the rising support of the common people for the rebellion, and the growing instability this causes the Han. Fervour increases in a region due to the presence of Yellow Turbans forces and buildings, causing increasingly punitive public order penalties for Han factions. At high levels, fervour begins to cross boundaries and affect adjacent regions. Han factions can mitigate the Yellow Turbans’ Fervour by improving their public order infrastructure and capturing nearby Yellow Turbans counties.Victory ConditionsAll followers of the Way of Supreme Peace are united in a common goal: overthrowing the Han Empire. The flames of rebellion will not be quenched until this goal is achieved! Some turns into the campaign the Mandate War will commence in earnest, driving the Yellow Turbans and the Han into relentless conflict. Victory in this war is the ultimate victory for the Yellow Turbans, and they must capture 50 regions or Luoyang itself.ReformsAll Yellow Turban factions have access to the new Yellow Turbans reforms tree. The tree contains four major branches, reflecting: Infrastructure & EconomyPhilosophy & TradeMilitary PowerMilitary DoctrinesYellow Turbans FactionsZhang JueA renowned healer in his native Julu commandery, Zhang Jue is known as the General of Heaven. His discovery of the Scriptures of Great Peace, detailing the connection between heaven and earth, have set him on the path to raising a righteous rebellion against the corrupt Han Dynasty. Zhang Jue has mustered his brothers and their followers to his cause and sparked a flame in the hearts of the people.Zhang LiangZhang Liang, the General of the People, is an artisan of defensive strategies. As such, his aim is to build an impregnable defence against the Han as they attempt to stamp out the rebellion. In fact, the Han warlord Lu Zhi has been dispatched with precisely this directive, and Zhang Liang has been tasked with defending against him. The result of this clash could dramatically shift the balance of power!Zhang BaoKnown as the General of the Land, Zhang Bao hones naked aggression into a force for change. He forms the spear-tip of the rebellion, hurling himself boldly into the fray. He seeks to rapidly expand the rebels' sphere of influence and is in the best position to achieve this.Other Factions also playable in Mandate of HeavenYou can also play this campaign from the perspective of several notable Three Kingdoms characters, each of whom has unique start-positions and missions reflecting their early (and in one case, deeply humble!) beginnings: Cao CaoLiu BeiSun JianDong ZhuoNew campaign features:Regionless RecruitmentIn the Mandate campaign, a faction’s armies may now recruit troops when in non-hostile territory, even if they own no regions. Units and retinues may be recruited, but new armies may not be formed.Emergent AI factionsAs time passes in the Mandate of Heaven campaign, notable factions from the 190 CE campaign will begin to emerge according to key historical conditions. For example, Yuan Shao may appear, but only if The Emperor is deposed, while Zheng Jiang will begin to terrorise the northern Commanderies around 189 CE.New battlefield units (highlights)With 40 new units available, playable factions get a range of new options for recruitment. Here you’ll find a list of some of the most notable elite units.Han EmpireImperial Conscripts (Liu Hong)The elite Imperial Army of the Han Empire, these units represent all five elements of the Wu Xing, and are all heavily armoured. All Imperial units have a unique ability granting them increasing armour and damage bonuses while fighting as long as another Imperial unit is nearby.Chen Peacekeepers (Liu Chong)The finest melee cavalry of Prince Liu Chong’s army, clad in heavy golden armour and also armed with crossbows.Chen Royal Guard (Liu Chong)Heavily armoured Crossbow Infantry, ready to switch to shield and spear in defence of their emperor.Destroyer of Traitors (Lu Zhi)A very effective Shock Cavalry unit with splash-damage attacks.Yellow TurbansMessengers of Heaven (Zhang Jue)Zhang Jue's messengers bear forth his prophecies and instructions. These very fast, unarmoured, fear-causing melee cavalry have good morale and are Ideal for chasing missile infantry down, killing them swiftly and moving on before others arrive. Zealots of the Way (Zhang Bao)Zhang Bao’s all-purpose infantry, equipped with two-handed polearms. Their unique ability improves their combat prowess over time at the front of the unit, though they become more vulnerable to the flanks and rear.Yaoguai Hunters (Zhang Bao)Zhang Bao’s Archers, armed with poisoned arrows. They can be deployed outside of the regular deployment zone before battle commences, and can only be detected from up close. They are deadly while they remain hidden, but the enemy must be kept at arm’s length as they will fall swiftly in melee.Tyrant Slayers (Zhang Liang)Zhang Liang’s Shock Cavalry, they have a very hard-hitting charge, and a unique damage bonus when fighting heroes and generals.\",\n",

To earn a little extra money you can scavenge the dumpsters and trash cans or even deliver newspapers around the island for extra spending loot. Explore the island on the Islandville bus system or even your very own golf cart.There is lots of highway traffic and tourist activity on the island all year round, so make sure to keep off the roads or you may get a little surprise. There is even a few areas planned for the future that are off limits for now and surrounded by construction fencing to keep you safe. The Islandville Transit bus is always running if you need to get around the island doing chores. To hail the bus, simply click the button in any bus stop and buy a bus pass. Each bus ride costs one pass ($1.50).With over 40 different games and machines there is already plenty to do on the island.

Each Astellian is charged with protecting the innocents of the world, a task that will take them through the darkest dungeons and across countless battlefields. Take up the Hero's Mantle and let your grand adventure begin; Astellia boasts a wide variety of unique and diverse dungeons, both for the solo player as well as parties, that reward those adventurers based on how well they perform. What better way to test your hard earned dungeoneering rewards than to take them to the arena? Arenas in Astellia offer both cooperative and competitive styles; whether you want to team up with your friends to fight hordes of monsters or go toe to toe against your fellow Astellians, the Coliseum will always provide for your competitive needs.For those, both bold and brave enough to crave more, the field of Avalon awaits your glorious conquest. Avalon is the grand battlefield where three factions clash and vie for dominance. To claim victory you must be prepared to raise an army, fight strategically, and commit your full military might in order to overcome your adversaries.All of these elements and so much more combine to bring the world of Astellia to life, all it is missing is your story. Through years of development, this fantasy has been made reality, and we hope that you will join us as we adventure forth to see what the future holds for all of us.\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"Several hundred years ago, a cataclysmic catastrophe nearly ripped your galaxy apart - an impassable ring of torn hyperspace fabric appeared in the center of the galaxy, which normal hyperspace engines can’t overcome.Since this Event nobody has managed to get near the central regions of the galaxy. All you know is that the Event also spawned multiple untraversable hyperspace rifts throughout the entire galaxy, and that a strange race of aliens, the Xsotan, has appeared in the center. It looks like these aliens have found a way to cross over the torn hyperspace fabric, but so far nobody has managed to establish contact with them.There are also rumors about a strange new metal called ‘Avorion’ which has appeared in the center of the galaxy around the same time as the Xsotan have arrived. Apparently the aliens use this material to build their ships.Start out as a nobody at the edge and work your way to the center of a galaxy that gets more dangerous, but also more rewarding the closer you get to its core. Avorion takes sandbox aspects from games like X or Freelancer, throws in co-op multiplayer and lets you build your own ships. It features ships made of freely scalable blocks that can be procedurally generated and that break into pieces where they're hit in space fights.Equip your ship with chainguns, lasers and other weaponry to take on your enemies and enjoy the sight of completely destructible ships breaking at the exact points where you hit them. Defend your allies from pirates, hunt down enemies for coin or even participate in wars between entire factions. Once you’re victorious, collect loot from defeated foes which you can use to upgrade your ship: new turrets with special abilities like autofire or repair beams, or system upgrades that allow you to install even more weapons. Build hangars and command squads of fighters in your battles or destroy enemy freighters to steal their cargo.Fly through beautiful nebulas and dense asteroid fields in search of hidden treasures and meet the many factions that populate and control their portion of the galaxy. Each faction has its own characteristics, such as peaceful, intelligent or aggressive, and its ships and stations have a distinct look.Explore the galaxy at your own pace to find valuable goods in old ship wrecks, undiscovered asteroid fields rich in resources, gigantic asteroids which you can claim for yourself, or clues about what happened during the Event a few centuries back.There are no limits to the size or complexity of your ship besides your resources. But there is also a creative mode where you can just build to your heart’s content. You're not bound to the standard voxel style and while building an awesome ship in Avorion you won't get lost in lots and lots of micro-management. You can focus on building a great looking ship, without having to worry about making it work. But always keep an eye on your ship’s maneuverability and energy requirements. Adjust your ship perfectly to its operational purpose: everything from light and agile explorers to heavily armored battleships with strong shields.And why build only one ship? Hire captains to fly your ships for you, manage your crews, weapons, hangars and fighters and build your own fleet of spaceships!Extend your ship with a cargo bay, find profitable deals and haul over a hundred trading goods across the galaxy to make a profit and buy your way up the food chain. Constructing a fleet of specialized transport ships with lots of cargo space will help you build up a trading corporation. Extend your influence in the galaxy by founding asteroid mines and factories that attract NPC traders who will buy and sell their goods at your establishments. Install trading systems which detect trading routes and supply and demand over multiple sectors and become the richest commander in the galaxy! Or maybe you're sick of being the good guy? Just raid freighters, smuggle illegal goods or become a headhunter.You don't have to face all of these challenges alone! Avorion features co-op multiplayer, so team up with your friends to build stations together and destroy pirates and enemy factions!

Enjoy detailed ship control panels and interiors. Then manage your dysfunctional crew and ship as you fend off bankruptcy...or worse.',\n",
       "  'full_bio': 'Ostranauts is a detailed simulation of owning and living aboard a spaceship, in a solar system where honest living is a slow death sentence. Set in the NEO Scavenger universe, where Earth has suffered cataclysmic collapse, the rest of the System lives on in a state of capitalist dystopia.Players will create their captain, use the spoils of their career history to build or restore a working ship, and find ways to keep their motley crew in line, fuel in their tanks, food on their plates, and the debt collectors at bay.Detailed Custom Ship DesignPlayers can build their ship, in any shape, from functioning modular parts. The parts have physical properties, they interact with each other, and can wear out over time.Crew NeedsCrew members have physiological and emotional needs, ranging from basal needs like food, water, oxygen, and temperature, to more esoteric needs like privacy, security, intimacy, and esteem.Systems ManagementOstranauts is a detailed simulation, with many interdependent systems. Players will have to manage supplies, emotions, power grids, finances, security, social ties, and more to keep their enterprise alive, both literally and figuratively.Crew AIEach crew member runs an AI that is constantly making choices based on their current needs and past experience. If one colleague is consistently comforting, and another threatening, an AI will seek out the former when they need security.Social \"Combat\"Socializing with crew uses a system a lot like NEO Scavenger\\'s combat, where players have social moves that can affect their moods and which replies are available. There are also single-use social moves that can be earned and used in this system to help in managing the encounter.First Person Control PanelsYou flip the switches, turn the knobs, and see the readouts of your ship\\'s systems.Rich, Drip-Fed LoreJust like in NEO Scavenger, the game is rich with hidden lore for those who want to seek it. Colonies and factions have long histories. Everyday products have brands and marketing. Unexplained phenomena have rumors echoing through the media and hidden files. And for those that don\\'t care, it doesn\\'t get in the way.Hard-ish ScienceThe tech-level in Ostranauts is near-future, but plausible. There is no faster-than-light travel, no sound in a void, no dogfighting, nor force fields. On the other hand, some ultra tech exists for the purposes of aesthetics and storytelling. E.g. fusion efficiency, cooling, and radiation shielding are enhanced. FTL texting is possible (albeit expensive and low-bandwidth). And the unexplained supernatural events seen in NEO Scavenger are not limited to Earth.Low-Stress Controls and PaceThe challenge of Ostranauts is in the decisions it presents, not the player\\'s endurance or reaction time. It plays in real-time with pause and fast-forward, to allow players to play at their own pace (similar to other management sims). Players should be able to take a break when they need to, and resume later. Similarly, players can fast-forward if they get bored, with the game auto-stopping when something requires the player\\'s attention.Original Soundtrack by Josh CullerJosh Culler, composer of the haunting NEO Scavenger soundtrack, is back again with an all-new body of work, specifically crafted for Ostranauts.Modding SupportMost of the game\\'s data is in plain-text files for easy access. Modders who want to make their experience more unique will be able to edit a wide variety of game data.',\n",

We need to be alive, not just exist. This is where The Pig steps in - a teacher that provides those selected with an opportunity to appreciate life yet again. To fight for our own survival, or simply let go and die. David Tapp thinks otherwise. He believes that everyone is free to live their own life, without the threat of death in the shape of a trap. A seasoned detective that seeks The Pig - a search that brings him to the Gideon Meat Plant.Puzzle me thisThey say that it’s good for the human race to solve puzzles, to make use of our highly developed brain. To get some of that “positive stress”. But there’s a limit. A lethal limit where blood gets involved and we create memories of something we rather forget. The Pig is the puzzlemaster, and we are the test subjects.The Saw Chapter is a Chapter for Dead by Daylight. It includes a new Killer, a Survivor and a Map.The PigThe Pig is a disciple of a mastermind known to the world as Jigsaw. In both The Pig and Jigsaw’s minds, they believe they are doing something necessary. Something that’ll make those placed inside their devious contraptions see life for what it really is once again. There are, of course, some sacrifices one must be willing to make, if one is to survive the “lesson”. Good luck…Killer Power - The Pig: Jigsaw's BaptismForever devoted to her master's cause, she punishes the ungrateful and the guilty with slyness and murderous puzzles. The Pig can move stealthily, dash in ambush attacks and put Reverse Bear Traps on Survivors' heads.Press the Active Ability button to assume a crouching position. While crouching:·         The Pig has no Terror Radius.·         Hold the Attack button to dash in an ambush attack.Start the trial with 4 Reverse Bear Traps:·         Reverse Bear Traps are put on Dying Survivors.·         Revere Bear Traps automatically sacrifice the survivor when they trigger.·         Reverse Bear Traps trigger automatically beyond the Exit Gates.·         Reverse Bear Traps trigger once the timer runs out.·         Reverse Bear Traps’ timers start when a generator is completed.·         Survivors can free themselves from Reverse Bear Traps by searching Jigsaw Boxes, located around the map, and finding the correct key.The Pig comes with 3 new perks.The focus of The Pig’s Perks is on pain and torture. A Hook is not that easy to flee from and all Survivors will be seriously tested when it comes to Skill Checks.Hangman's TrickYour ingenious modifications to Hooks prevent tampering and permanent damage. Hooks destroyed by sabotage or sacrifices repair after a short moment. Gain a notification when someone starts Sabotaging the Hooks.SurveillanceUnlocks potential in one's Aura reading ability. The last regressing generators' Auras are revealed to you.Make your ChoiceWhen a survivor rescues another from a hook at least 48/40/32 meters away from you, Make your Choicetriggers and applies the Exposed Status Effect on the rescuer for 60 sec. Make your choice has a cooldown of 60 seconds.The DetectiveDavid Tapp is one of the few good guys left. Someone who actually seeks justice. After years of wearing the shield, he caught the most horrendous case yet. A fiendish being that reserved the right to unleash torture upon the world as it was considered “needed”. A frantic chase began, making David end up at the Realm of the Entity where the search never ends.\\u2003David Tapp comes with 3 new Perks.TenacityThere is nothing stopping you. Your ferocious tenacity in dire situations allows you to crawl faster and recover at the same time.Detective’s HunchUnlocks potential in one's Aura reading ability. When completing a Generator, the Auras of Generators, Chests and Totems within range are revealed to you for 3 seconds. If you are holding a Map that can track objectives, objectives revealed by Detective's Hunch are added to the map.Stake OutGetting close to the Killer fills you with determination. When standing within the Killer Terror Radius for some time and not in a Chase, you gain a Token up to a maximum. When Stake Out has at least 1 Token, Good Skill Checks are considered Great Skill Checks and consume 1 Token.The AbattoirThe Gideon Meat Plant is no longer a place of death designed for animals. Its focus has shifted towards the human race. You can still sense a scent of blood mixed with rust and fear. Thousands upon thousands of animals have met their end at this place, but those humans who enter the premises are not supposed to die. They are meant to survive and learn. But the majority of those who participate will fail.\",\n",

The creak and groan of living wood echoes from its dim interior, the canopy seems to absorb all light, and half-seen spirits dart between the twilit bowers. To enter is to place your fate in their hands.Within dwell the Asrai, the Wood Elves. Though they hail originally from Ulthuan to the west as all Elves do, they spurn the sanctimonious arrogance of the Asur, the High Elves, and the murderous decadence of the Druchii or Dark Elves. The Asrai consider themselves to be the only true Elves left in the world, as they embrace all aspects of their nature – both light and dark – and for thousands of years, they have lived in harmony with the sentient forest.The Asrai share the wilds of Athel Loren with its spirits and protectors: the Dryads, Branchwraiths and the ancient guardian Treemen. They adopt its steeds, hawks and Great Eagles for their warhosts, and even rare Forest Dragons may deign to join them when the need is dire. Peerless archers and riders, the Wood Elves pay fealty to the demigod Orion, who dies in flame each midwinter, only to be reborn into thunderous life in spring beneath The Oak of Ages.Wild, lithe, and utterly ruthless in defence of their land, only a fool would goad the Wood Elves and their spirited allies to conflict. For those who witness the awesome spectacle of an Asrai host marching out of the woodlands on a Wild Hunt, it is likely the last thing they will ever see.Campaign playstyleThe Wood Elves campaign offers a uniquely different campaign experience to the other playable races of Total War: WARHAMMER. Their major infrastructure is housed in the Wood Elf settlements of Athel Loren, though they are capable of expanding outwards, capturing settlements and building limited outposts, known as Asrai Lookouts, in their stead. The heart of the campaign is The Great Oak, a unique 5-tier building related to the new Wonder victory condition.In battle, the Wood Elves are swift and deadly, fielding many ‘glass cannon’ style units. While less physically robust than most other races, and with smaller unit sizes, they make up for this with excellent melee and ranged capabilities. They field some of the best archers in the game, many of whom can move and fire, and may later be upgraded with a range of specialised ammunition. They are often accompanied in battle by the woodland kin of Athel Loren, such as Dryads, Eagles and Treemen. Their spellcasters wield the Lores of Life, Beasts and Shadows.New Story Campaign: The Season of RevelationSet across a beautiful and highly-detailed campaign map of Athel Loren and the surrounding Duchies of Breton, The Season of Revelation is playable as either Durthu or Orion, the Wood Elves’ two Legendary Lords. This campaign tasks the player with uniting Athel Loren in the face of Bretonnian incursions and, later, from a series of fearsome, climactic attacks by the Beastman warlord Morghur, and his corrupted bray-herds.The Oak of AgesThe vast, ancient bowers of The Oak of Ages mark the spiritual heart of Athel Loren and the source of its sacred power.In the Grand Campaign, The Oak of Ages is a unique 5-tier Wonder building sited in Athel Loren which the player must grow over the course of the campaign. As the Wood Elf player advances it to each new tier, they will receive increasing bonuses to their campaign.Growing The Oak to tier 5 initiates The Battle of The Great Oak, a climactic multi-stage assault on Athel Loren’s spiritual centre by the combined and massed hordes of the Beastmen and Chaos Warriors. Victory (or survival!) marks the completion of the Wood Elves’ key campaign objective. New additional currency: AmberAlongside Gold, the Wood Elves require Amber to recruit certain elite units, to unlock certain technologies, and to expand the Oak of Ages. This is a finite resource in the world however, and can only be gained by capturing settlements and setting up Asrai Lookouts. As Amber is limited, this presents the player with a constant choice over whether it should be spent on faction development, military might or achieving their key victory condition.Wood Elf Settlements and OutpostsThe Wood Elves are capable of capturing any province in The Old World, regardless of its race origin. However, these settlement locations can only ever house Asrai Lookouts with very limited building options, turning them into army replenishment stops, recruitment stations (with access to the global recruitment pool but at local recruitment pricing), or as centres to exploit any regional trade resources. Major building chains will need to be built in the regions of Athel Loren itself, the only true home of the Wood Elves. Settlements in Athel Loren have 10 building slots, providing space to explore the Wood Elves’ extensive building trees.Wood Elves infrastructureThe Wood Elves have unique tech trees and buildings, and as a highly developed and somewhat aristocratic race, the Wood Elf Council presides over matters social and military. This Council has a number of Offices to which characters may be appointed, and is subtly connected to the Wood Elves’ infrastructure. Certain buildings unlock Offices for example: if the Wild Heath building is unlocked in the tech tree, it can be built in a settlement, thereby unlocking the Herald Of The Hunt office. If one of the player’s Lords is appointed to this role, he will periodically call a Wild Hunt. This gives the Herald and his army a series of very significant bonuses for the turns in which the Wild Hunt event is active, heightening their marshal prowess and encouraging aggressive actions. Players are advised to explore these interconnections in order to get the most out of their Wood Elf campaigns.The two Wood Elves legendary Lords, Orion and Durthu, both have Offices to which only they can be appointed, providing them with further campaign bonuses.New Legendary LordsA Wood Elves Grand Campaign may be led by one of two Legendary Lords: the demigod Orion, The King in The Woods, or the ancient Treeman, Durthu. Each begins play in a different starting position, controlling a different Athel Loren faction, and bring their own suite of campaign bonuses.Orion The King in The WoodsOrion is the immortal demigod-king of Athel Loren and the Wood Elves. When his realm is threatened, he is the first to take up arms and fight in its defence. Every Elf feels the lure of their king’s wild summons, and many are overcome by their primal urges, abandoning civilised concerns and for the thrill of the hunt, and the heady tang of blood upon the wind. Orion is a powerful melee warrior who also can deal sizeable ranged damage with his long-range spear attacks. He also has two unique area-effect abilities: Hounds of Orion, a magical vortex, and Hawk’s Talon, a magical bombardment. These attacks are bound to Orion and do not consume Winds of Magic.Orion has two combat skill trees, two battle skill trees, and a campaign skill tree. This great range of skills, many of which are unique, allows him to specialise as he levels up. In particular, he can bring numerous improvements to the many bow units in the Wood Elves roster. When recruiting forces, Orion must pay an extra cost in Amber to hire woodland spirit units.DurthuMost ancient of the might Treemen of Athel Loren, Durthu was once a benevolent creature who found joy in the weave of forest life. It was he who first bound the spirits of the woodlands to the fate of the Asrai. And for a time, things existed in balance and harmony.After many bloody incursions into Athel Loren however, with countless tress felled by outsiders for fuel, or merely out of spite, Durthu has become embittered. Worse still, he believes the Wood Elves themselves invited many of these calamities. Now, he does not consider them friends: merely allies in a common cause. In the grand Campaign, Durthu leads the woodland spirits of the region of Argwylon in Athel Loren.  When recruiting forces, he must pay an extra cost in Amber to hire Wood Elf units. A powerful warrior and spellcaster, Durthu also wields the Lore of Beasts, and may summon Manticores into the thick of battle using The Transformation of Kadon.New LordsWood Elves armies may recruit two new types of Lord to command their armies: Glade lords and Treemen.Glade LordsThe Highborn lords and ladies of Athel Loren have ruled the Wood Elves for millennia, and when the race goes to war, it is these nobles that direct their forces. Powerful warriors and excellent archers, they have two personal combat skill trees, each of which brings improvements to their archery and melee abilities. Likewise, their Battle trees augment their armies along two different paths – mell and ranged. They may also unlock three mount options as they level up: the Elven Steed, Great Eagle, and Forest Dragon.Ancient TreemenAncient Treemen are colossal in stature. Revered by Elf and forest-creature alike, their strength rivals that of even the dragons of the deep glades. The true guardians of the forest, these mighty woodland spirits are Spellcaster lords who wield the Lore of Beasts. While they have no mount options (there are few creatures in the world big enough to accommodate them), they have unique skills which grant increasing protection to all Tree Kin units in their armies.HeroesWood Elves armies may recruit three new types of Hero units to support their armies and perform Campaign Map actions. Each offers strong specialisation paths via their skill trees.Spellsingers (Mage focus)Wood Elf mages have a unique relationship with Athel Loren. Connected to the deeper intelligence of the forest, they are highly attuned beings, sharing a bond with their surroundings in much the same way the Dryads, sprites and Treemen do. Spellsingers may be recruited to wield the Lores of Life, Shadow and Beasts.Branchwraiths (Melee/Mage focus)Eldest of the Dryads, Branchwraith serve as handmaidens to the ancients of Athel Loren. Before the coming of the Elves, it was they who ruled the forest and tamed the Winds of Magic to bring sustenance to the wild woodlands. There is no love lost between Branchwraiths and the Asrai, though the uneasy peace continues, and these skilled practitioners of The Lore of Life can be found in many Wood Elf warhosts, casting spells in the thick of battle one minute, striking down foes with their powerful limbs the next.Waystalkers (Spy, Ranged focus)The most skilled marksmen of the Waywatchers, Waystalkers are obsessed with The Hunt. Taciturn, solitary individuals, they show a dedication to their path that puts them in closer touch with the forest than their Elven kin. Expert snipers, they can move – and even remain hidden – while firing, singling out targets for the kill with a ruthless precision that no other archer can match.Unit rosterThe Wood Elves roster contains many skilled archer units. When certain structures have been built, Glade Guard, Deepwood Scouts and Glade Riders may be recruited to fire three specialised ammunition types:Starfire shafts (Fire damage)Hagbane Tips (Poison damage)Swift Silver Shards (Magical damage)Melee InfantryEternal GuardEternal Guard (shields)WardancersWardancers (Asrai spears)Wildwood RangersRanged infantryGlade GuardGlade Guard (Starfire Shafts)Glade Guard (Hagbane Tips)Deepwood ScoutsDeepwood Scouts (Swift Shiver Shafts)WaywatchersMelee CavalryWild RidersWild Riders (shields)Ranged cavalry Glade RidersGlade Riders (Hagbane Tips)Hawk Riders (flying)Magical cavalrySisters of The Thorn (may cast bound spells)Woodland Spirit unitsDryadsTreekinTreemanMonstrous UnitsGreat Eagle (flying)Forest Dragon (flying)',\n",

       "  'full_bio': 'Among the nations on the Zemurian continent, the mighty Erebonian Empire has been quick to outwardly stake its claim militarily; yet politically, ugly bouts of internal conflict between the upper class and commoners attempting to rise to power have been steadily intensifying day by day. The Noble and Reformist Factions have been none too kind to one another over the years, and tensions between the two only stand to worsen if compromises aren’t made in the very near future. Rean Schwarzer, like any other citizen of the Imperial Nation, is no stranger to these rising conflicts: the class system has been deeply embedded into the hearts of every Erebonian since the days of old.

       "  'full_bio': \"About This ContentSid Meier's Civilization V: Gods and Kings is the first expansion pack for Civilization V - the critically acclaimed 2010 PC Game of the Year. This robust expansion covers the entire scope of time from founding your first Pantheon of the Gods and spreading religion across the world, to deploying your spies in enemy cities in order to steal information and technology.As you move through the ages, you’ll interact with new types of city-states, engage in new city-state quests and global competitions, and master exciting new systems for land and naval combat. Civilization V: Gods and Kings will also include nine new civilizations, nine new wonders, three original scenarios, and dozens of new units, buildings, and techs that will offer even more ways for players to expand their empire and dominate the world.Key Features:Expanded Epic Game: The core game experience has been greatly expanded with the addition of new technologies (like Combined Arms), 27 new units (like the new 1-hex ranged unit Machine Gunner), 13 new buildings (like the Bomb Shelter), and 9 new Wonders (see below). Additionally, there are even more new units and buildings included in the three new Scenarios for modders to use.New Civilizations: The expansion will deliver 9 new civilizations, such as Carthage, Netherlands, the Celts, and the Maya (it is 2012, after all), along with their unique traits, units and buildings. The expansion also includes 9 new leaders including William I, Prince of Orange, Boudicca and Pacal the Great.Religion:  A righteous people will seek out Faith to found a Pantheon of the Gods. As your Faith becomes stronger, you can cultivate Great Prophets who build on these simple beliefs to create a religion that you can customize and enhance as desired. Are you tolerant of other religions or is this the one true faith? Are you focused on Gold, Arts or Military? Beliefs can even unlock custom buildings that only people of your religion can construct. Great prophets, missionaries and inquisitors help you spread your beliefs to other lands and gain the alliances of City States, and like-minded civilizations. Enhanced Diplomacy and Espionage: Establish embassies at foreign courts for closer ties (or clandestine operations). As the religions of the world start settling in, and the world moves into the Renaissance, you unlock your first spy (with more to come). Send them out to establish surveillance of foreign cities, steal advanced technologies from your strongest or wisest competitors, or interfere with city-state alliances. All of your actions can have a diplomatic impact if discovered, so always tread carefully.City-States: Two new city-state types have been added (Mercantile and Religious) to bring all new advantages to the table. The city-state quest system has received a complete overhaul to decrease the importance of gold and add a whole range of new quests that further the narrative of the game, as well as make the diplomatic victory a more varied option. Ally with Marrakech to get access to their unique luxury resources! Vatican City and Jerusalem are holy cities that play key roles in the religious struggle.World Domination: The fight for world domination is now more dynamic than ever before. The Gods and Kings expansion features a reworked combat system and AI that puts more emphasis on a balanced army composition. The new system allows your lines to stand longer than they could before, so you, as a player, can make smarter tactical decisions without worrying about a single unlucky roll of the dice.Naval Combat: Your navy is now split into two different ship types, melee and ranged. This means that no coastal city should be considered safe, and can now fall to a surprise naval attack. Additionally, all embarked units now have Defensive Embarkation, and can stack with a naval unit for extra protection. Add to this the new Great Admiral, and the high seas have become a much more dangerous place.New Wonders: There will be 9 new Wonders with all new effects including Neuschwanstein, the Great Mosque of Djenne, the Terracotta Army, the Great Firewall, and the Hubble Space Telescope.Three new Scenarios:Medieval: Grow your medieval kingdom into one of the great nations of Renaissance Europe, fending off outside invasions from Mongols and Ottoman Turks and fighting the religious wars of the Crusades and Reformation!Fall of Rome: Play as either Eastern Rome or Western Rome trying to fend off the barbarians OR as one of the barbarians themselves. Empires of the Smoky Skies: Build flying airships and huge tractor-like tanks from the unique tech tree of this Victorian science-fiction scenario, and use them to spread your empire across the pre-industrial world.Note - DemoThe demo is available on PC only\",\n",

       "  'full_bio': 'About This ContentRoll in heavy firepower and take control of the battlefield with three brand new armored vehicles in the Arma 3 Tanks DLC.Key FeaturesT-140 Angara - The T-140 Angara is a Main Battle Tank (MBT) of Russian design and is used by the CSAT faction. This vehicle is built to deliver maximum destruction, while providing the best kind of protection to its crew. The Angara\\'s primary weapon is a new 125 mm cannon, which can fire three different kinds of ammunition, and has a longer effective range than the cannons on most Western tanks. Its secondary weapons are a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun and a 12.7 mm heavy machine gun. Aside from the regular T-140, the Angara also comes in the T-140K \\'Commander\\' variant, which replaces the heavy machine gun for a 30 mm autocannon, and is equipped with sensors to share target data via the Data Link with other units.AWC Nyx - The Nyx Armored Weapons Carrier (AWC) is of German engineering descent, but was licensed and modified by the AAF faction. Its smaller size makes it relatively fast and mobile, and even allows for it to be slingloaded by the CH-49 Mohawk helicopter. The Nyx comes in four variants: Anti-Tank, Anti-Air, Recon, and the Autocannon variant. All of these variants wear an armor jacket that is able to withstand 7.62 ammunition, but each vehicle variant carries different types of weapons or equipment to serve specific needs on the battlefield. Just like the other new vehicles in this DLC, the Nyx is available in multiple liveries.Rhino MGS - The Rhino is a wheeled Armored Fighting Vehicle (AFV) that is purpose-built to fight against tanks. For this reason, it\\'s also referred to as a \\'Tank Destroyer\\'. The Rhino MGS has a 120 mm cannon, which can fire all kinds of standard rounds, but also the new MARUK ATGM. It has a secondary weapon in the form of a coaxial .338 magnum machine gun. The Rhino also comes in the UP variant. This variant features an additional remote 12.7 mm heavy machine gun turret, and improved protection in the form of cage and ERA armor. It makes the UP more suitable for Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), but does add weight and limits options for transport. Both variants of the Rhino are connected to the Data Link, which enables them to lock onto targets picked up or painted by friendly armed forces.\"Altis Requiem\" Mini-Campaign - Over the course of three singleplayer scenarios, you assume the role of an AAF tank commander, and you get to experience the opposite perspective of the NATO offensive featured in Arma 3\\'s vanilla \"The East Wind\" campaign. Here, you\\'re placed in command of the new AWC Nyx in the fight against the FIA. Later you\\'re also presented with the opportunity to operate the new T-140 Angara Main Battle Tank. This short mini-campaign leads to different possible endings based on your playstyle and performance.Showcase Tank Destroyers - In this singleplayer Showcase scenario, you play as a NATO crewman on board the new Rhino MGS UP. This Tank Destroyer has similar firepower to a Main Battle Tank, but is much more vulnerable in terms of armor protection. As such, you will need to make a good use of the Rhino\\'s speed and maneuverability to complete your objectives.Platform UpdateThe Arma 3 Tanks DLC is supported by a major Arma 3 platform update, introducing a wide variety of free new content and features. This platform update is free for all Arma 3 owners.Free Supporting FeaturesEnhanced Armored Vehicle Experience - A combination of upgrades makes operating armored vehicles a much more immersive experience. These improvements apply to all armored vehicles in Arma 3.Interiors - Every armored vehicle in Arma 3 now features a fully 3D-modeled interior with Multi-Functional Displays and camera feeds for crew members.Improved Handling - Armored vehicles now feel more natural to drive thanks to improvements to the wheel collision simulation, the way different ground surfaces affect handling, and other changes.Extended Damage Model - Armor now reacts more realistically to incoming rounds. For example, this means that cage armor (also known as slat armor) is not just a visual object, but really does offer protection against RPGs.Upgraded Audio - The audio experience of armored vehicles is made more lifelike via the addition of more stereo sound samples, positional sounds, and more distinct audio cues for gearbox and RPM changes.Vehicle Customization - Armored vehicles can be customized in the Virtual Garage with additional armor protection and camouflage nets for better concealment in different terrains.Fire-Control System - Several ground vehicles and aircraft are equipped with the Fire-Control System (FCS). This technology measures the range and speed of targets, and adjusts a weapon\\'s zeroing and calculates the lead to increase the chances of a first-round hit (FCS was initially implemented as part of the Arma 3 Jets DLC).New Missile Flight Profiles & Capabilities - A selection of missiles now feature direct or top-down attack flight modes, plus support for terrain-following munitions has been added. A few weapons now also have the ability to lock-on after launch.Free Bonus Content\"Vanguard\" Team-vs-Team Multiplayer Mode - In these competitive combined arms scenarios, an important device is paradropped on a random spot on the map, and its precise location is gradually revealed as the package gets closer to the ground. To win, one of three opposing teams needs to pick up the device, and return it to their base within a certain time limit. A team also wins when they\\'ve eliminated the other teams in combat or when they have the highest score at the end of the match.3 Time Trial Challenges - Skilled drivers can put the new T-140 Angara, AWC Nyx, and Rhino MGS to the test in three speedy time trial races across Altis and Malden.2 Anti-Tank Launchers - Some of Arma 3\\'s factions are reinforced with brand new launchers. CSAT\\'s 9M135 Vorona is a manually guided missile launcher with powerful optics featuring a high 6 or 12x magnification, Thermal Imaging, and a laser rangefinder. The MAAWS Mk4 is an unguided recoilless rifle, which is available in the older Mod 0 version used by AAF and FIA, and the newer Mod 1 version that is employed by NATO. The MAAWS is lighter than the RPG-42, and fires smaller HEAT (High-Explosive Anti-Tank) rounds, but is a bit more precise and has a longer range.Additional Anti-Tank Vehicle Variants - The Offroad pickup and the Prowler and Qilin Light Strike Vehicles from the Arma 3 Apex expansion now also have variants carrying mounted launchers (the LSVs are only available to owners of Arma 3 Apex).Decorative Objects - Several new decorative objects are made available to Arma 3 content creators, such as new tank barricades, spare parts, and tools. There is also a fully functional repair depot, which can be used to repair damaged vehicles.Official Soundtrack - Listen to new music tracks composed specifically for this DLC.Steam Achievements - Unlock a set of extra Steam Achievements related to the new content.',\n",

       "  'full_bio': \"Note (June 18, 2019):  This game is being updated weekly.  That means it's going to change, a lot, over the next few years.  The game is already playable, feature-complete, stable, and chocked full of content---it's already an entertaining and interesting game.  However, my goal is to make the very best game possible.  In a large-scale multiplayer setting, it's very difficult to predict the group dynamics that will result from a given change, so there will be some experimentation along the way.  You may not like every change that I make, but you should know that I'm working hard and doing my best to explore this brand new design space, and we'll hopefully end up, eventually, at the best destination possible.  In the rare case where a given change ends up being completely disastrous, I always act quickly to fix it.  There are hard problems to solve, and with your support and input, we can solve them together.  That is part of what you are buying when you buy this game:  a seat at the table around a game that is changing and improving week after week.  Thanks for your input, trust, and support during this process!  --JasonNote (March 13, 2020):  Over the past two years, the game has been updated 92 times, with a total of 2812 new objects added, for an average of 30 new objects per update.  Some weeks, when I was focused on fixing other things, very few new objects were added.  Dozens of new things are not added every single week, but dozens are added on average.  The game is updated in a substantial way every single week, however---except, obviously, when I'm sick or on vacation.  The trailer depicts a potential future for the game.  There aren't robots in the game (yet), but there are loads of things that weren't shown in the trailer (radios, airplanes, rail carts, oil rigs, ice cream, etc.)  At least 2812 things weren't shown in the trailer, in fact.  For a game that's changing weekly, a trailer gives you only a general idea of what the game is like, and where it's headed.  The current plan is to get up to robots in the game someday, but, like I say in the trailer, who knows where we'll end up?  --JasonDescriptionA multiplayer survival game of parenting and civilization building. Get born to another player as your mother. Live an entire life in one hour. Have babies of your own in the form of other players. Leave a legacy for the next generation as you help to rebuild civilization from scratch.Hey folks, I'm Jason Rohrer, and I've been working on One Hour One Life for more than three years.  I've been doing everything myself---I drew all the graphics on paper with pens and markers, I coded the entire engine from scratch, I composed and performed all of the music, and I even made all of the sound effects.  It's a very personal game, and it's really unlike anything else that's out there.  It's also a huge game---over 1300 fully interactive, craftable objects already.  And it's only getting bigger, with weekly updates adding new things all the time.  The game was initially released on my own website in February of 2018, and over the intervening months, I released 29 updates off-Steam.  I've promised to keep releasing weekly update for at least the next two years, with the end goal of making the largest, most comprehensive crafting game in history.Okay, so what about the game itself?First of all, you only live for an hour, where each minute marks a passing year.  You join the game server as a newborn baby, and some other randomly-chosen player is your mother.  You depend on her for your survival.  And why will she be willing to waste her valuable time and resources to keep you alive?  Because she's going to die in an hour just like everyone else, and if she wants what she accomplishes in her lifetime to have any meaning, then the next generation (aka, you) is her only hope.  And if you survive into adulthood, you may get the chance to have babies of your own---other players, just joining the server---and those babies will be the next generation that gives meaning to your own life accomplishments.Across this ever-growing family tree of generations, players are collectively conducting an enormous project:  they are rebuilding civilization from scratch.  The online game world starts out as a near-infinite expanse of wilderness (four billion meters wide from east to west, and four billion meters wide from north to south, with a total surface area of over 18,000,000,000,000,000,000 square meters, or 36,000 times bigger than Earth).  The very first player to join the server is Eve, and she starts out in the wilderness as the root of the family tree.  Eve and her immediate offspring lay the foundation for the future civilization, perhaps making a few primitive tools, cooking basic foods, and starting a small farm as they scrape out a meager existence before dying.  Future generations will build on this primitive foundation, eventually mastering more and more advanced technology, including domesticated animals, metal working, permanent buildings, and transportation networks.But as real-life history has shown, civilization is fragile.  A generation that is born into the lap of luxury---on the backs of their ancestors' hard-won accomplishments---can just as easily squander their inheritance as build upon it.  Key resources run out over time, so careful management, planning, and organization are necessary to prevent an inevitable collapse.  Thus, the game graduates from the individual challenge of primitive survival in the early stages to a group organizational and leadership challenge in the later stages.  How do rules and procedures for group survival propagate across multiple generations?  What did our great grandparents have in mind for this village?The main mode in the game involves being born as a helpless baby to another player as your mother, but you can also play with your friends as twins, triplets, or quadruplets.  One baby is hard enough to take care of---any mother that can successfully take care of quadruplets deserves the eternal gratitude of you and your friends.All of this is happening on my own centrally-managed, persistent servers, and your purchase includes a lifetime account on these official servers.  After you buy the game, you can instantly connect to this world with no configuration or server set-up.  It all just works.  You also get access to the full source code, including the server code.  Technically-minded folks can run their own private servers, or even use the powerful content editor to make their own mods. I hope you'll join us as this sprawling civilization-building experiment continues to unfold.  Many thousands of players have already collectively lived over 400,000 hours in this endlessly-changing world so far.  Before the Steam release, the average playtime for each player was 17 hours, with dozens of players logging over 500 hours each, and 94% positive off-Steam player reviews.  This is a deep and rich game already, and there are still hundreds of content updates to come.No two lives are ever the same, and a new story always awaits on the other side of the [GET REBORN] button.Jason RohrerOctober 2018Davis, California\",\n",

Innocents must stay alert, traverse the three zones and escape through the safety hatch as the infected try to pick you off one by one.When playing as an innocent, you’ll progress through the map and come across items to help you survive as you advance towards the exit. However, you will need to decide which of these are most valuable to you, and whether to collaborate or fight with other players to get your hands on them. Every decision gives you more information on your teammates and what side they’re likely to be on. A test of strategy and skill, innocents must work together to gather weapons, secure objectives and vote out those suspected of infection to strengthen their chances of survival. But the environment has been setup to cause conflict amongst the group, creating doubt about the true intentions of players. The infected will be busy collecting bloody and trying to cover up their sabotage attempts, whilst the innocents will be keeping an eye out for suspicious behaviour and attempting to make alliances with those they think they can trust. At the end of each zone, a blackout period occurs, allowing the infected players to transform into their terror form and attack. You’ll need this form to kill innocent players. In terror form you’re faster, stronger, and have better vision than your innocent victims and with an array of intense killing animations you’ll be able to create some frightening but also amusing gameplay!Deceit combines the frenzy of fast paced combat mixed with strategic gameplay, and of course the psychological mind games of determining who you can trust.',\n",

But when the Overlords fled the planet, they left their former soldiers behind. Now, five years after the events of XCOM 2, humans and aliens are working together to forge a civilization of cooperation and coexistence.Welcome to City 31, a model of peace in a post-invasion world. However, not all of Earth's inhabitants support interspecies alliance. Chimera Squad, an elite force of human and alien agents, must work together to destroy the underground threats driving the city toward chaos.Your agents are unique: each of them equipped with special tactical abilities and driven by a different motivation for joining Chimera Squad. Deploy targeted team members to investigate and combat the dangers that pervade the districts of City 31. Lead Chimera Squad through a new experience that innovates on XCOM's turn-based legacy, utilizing strategy, teamwork, and new breach-and-clear gameplay to complete your mission objectives.The future of City 31 depends on you.Unique Alien and Human AgentsEach of the 11 agents have their own distinct personality and tactical abilities, including species-specific attacks like the Viper’s tongue pull.Specialized and Complementary Classes Execute devastating combos by teaming the right agents and utilizing cooperative actions. The difference between mission success and failure can depend wholly on team composition.Re-Envisioned Tactical Combat Missions are structured as a series of discrete, explosive encounters, keeping the action intense and unpredictable.Breach Mode Shape the battlefield to your advantage with a new combat phase that injects your squad right into action. Strategically assign your agents to different entry points and coordinate their assault with a range of Breach-specific skills.Interleaved Turns An automatic initiative system slots individual agents and enemies into an alternating turn order, creating new strategic possibilities based on what unit is queued to act next—and what unit is at the greatest risk when they do.Suspenseful Strategy Layer Outside of combat, manage the operations of a high-tech HQ, where you must prioritize competing tasks, investigations, and agent assignments in the face of a ticking clock: the constantly rising unrest in the city’s various districts, driving City 31 closer and closer to total anarchy.\",\n",

Now this coder (it’s you!) must learn all there is to know about machine learning and use visual programming to build a cat-to-human speech recognition system.This game fits best for...- People who want to know more about how machine learning and related technologies work- Parents and teachers who are looking for a fun and easy way to make an intro to logical thinking, programming, and technologies for kids- Programmers who want to learn new concepts that they can apply to their own coding- Those who want to play games and not feel guilty about ‘wasting their time’ (although we believe you shouldn’t feel guilty at all while playing games!)- Players who like to keep their brains busy and working in different ways, while still having fun- Gamers looking to improve their problem-solving skills and feel immense sense of satisfaction and achievement that comes along with it- People who like smart catsLearn how machine learning works in real life!The game is loosely based on real-life machine learning technologies: from goofy Expert Systems to mighty Recurrent Neural Networks, capable of predicting the future. Don’t worry: it all plays out as a puzzle game. No coding experience required!Train yourself into a data science wizard!Drag objects around your screen with a mouse! Connect them with lines (oh yeah)! Try. Fail. Optimize. Try again. Then press “Release” button and see that sweet pieces of data flow smoothly through your screen.Embrace an adventurous lifestyle of a machine learning specialist! Designing a groundbreaking technology requires time, experience and money. That means you’ll have to work as a freelancer, with all the excitement that comes along with it. Receive emails! Accept contracts! Sit alone in a dark room for days without saying a single word! Socialize on forums! That’s what real data scientists do!Coding just got real!Our quests are based on actual problems, solved by machine learning. This includes building a self-driving car (with your cat as a pilot). And if you really want to test your programming might, you can become a CTO of a startup: it’s your skills and your schemes against the savage laws of the market! Earn a fortune, flip off your bosses and become a tech guru… Or lose everything and crawl back to the doorstep of HR department: at least it was worth trying, right?Improve your gear, improve your life!Once you ensure a stable cashflow, you’ll be able to buy yourself a bunch of fancy hardware to improve your performance. But it’s not just about the hardware! Buy yourself a new smartphone or a geeky figurine! Buy fancy outfits for your cat! Hell, you can even buy yourself an aloe!Fun fact: this is what machine learning specialists actually do. Now, you can become one of them (minus the money)! while True: learn() is the best game about being a data science specialist because no one else has been weird enough to make another one!',\n",
